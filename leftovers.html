        Time's arrow is<em> outward</em>, with the flow of energy (radiation
        arrow of time, FETH 171), and with entropy. Mass slows (and reverses?)
        this flow. Gravity makes for a non-entropic distribution of gas in a
        volume : in free fall, tidal forces push toward center and up/down. This
        is gravity's defining characteristic, what distinguishes it from
        acceleration. It runs the film backward from an even distribution to a
        biased one. It also slows imaginary time (Interstellar). </li>

        "“GR=QM,” Leonard Susskind claimed boldly in an open letter to
        researchers in quantum information science: general relativity is
        nothing but quantum mechanics—a hundred-year-old theory that has been
        applied extremely successfully to all sorts of things but never really
        entirely understood. As Sean Carroll has pointed out, “Maybe it was a
        mistake to quantize gravity, and space-time was lurking in quantum
        mechanics all along.” For the future, “rather than quantizing gravity,
        maybe we should try to gravitize quantum mechanics. Or, more accurately
        but less evocatively, ‘find gravity inside quantum mechanics,’” "</li>
      <li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy "What are called
        Maxwell's equations today, are in fact a simplified version of the
        original equations reformulated by Heaviside, FitzGerald, Lodge and
        Hertz. The original equations used Hamilton's more expressive quaternion
        notation,[164] a kind of Clifford algebra, which fully subsumes the
        standard Maxwell vectorial equations largely used today.[165] In the
        late 1880s there was a debate over the relative merits of vector
        analysis and quaternions. According to Heaviside the electromagnetic
        potential field was purely metaphysical, an arbitrary mathematical
        fiction, that needed to be "murdered".[166] It was concluded that there
        was no need for the greater physical insights provided by the
        quaternions <strong>if the theory was purely local</strong> in nature.
        Local vector analysis has become the dominant way of using Maxwell's
        equations ever since. However, this strictly vectorial approach has led
        to a restrictive topological understanding in some areas of
        electromagnetism, for example, a full understanding of the energy
        transfer dynamics in Tesla's oscillator-shuttle-circuit can only be
        achieved in quaternionic algebra or higher SU(2) symmetries.[167] It has
        often been argued that <strong>quaternions </strong>are not <strong>compatible
          with special relativity</strong>,[168] but<strong> multiple papers
          have shown ways of incorporating relativity</strong>.[169][170][171][172]"</li>

    <h4><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gravitational waves</strong></h4>
    <p>What would be the effect of massive gravitational waves in our familiar
      world? See Sean carroll. Also Hartle p. 337 (illustrated).&nbsp; Wheeler
      187.</p>
    <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jVYe_g6y2E 7:00</p>

    <p>Wheeler 232 g-mag (frame dragging) and Mach's principle<br>
    </p>
    <p>Gravity is like magnetism in some ways but opposite in others. When we
      see relative motion between a charge and current, the magnetic force is
      because of how the charge density has changes from the moving point of
      view. When we release something from rest at some height, it drops not
      because it is already moving, but because there are other frames of
      reference in which it is? Or is it that we only <em>imagine</em> that it
      was at rest, when it was in fact moving back and forth across tiny
      distances? Is that how gravitomagnetism is activated (below)? How would
      that be any different from supposing that it really <em>has</em> no
      precise location and that when it has to keep choosing one at random, the
      odds are biased in favor of the curvature of space?</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so, why do things fall down??</h4>
    <p>&nbsp;IV-52. Curved space alone seems insufficient to explain why the
      apple falls. It's usually the "curvature of time" which is given credit
      for this. "It seems unlikely that a more beautiful and simple model than
      the 4D one will be possible, my objections notwithstanding." Do I still
      see it that way? I don't think so. Just add my Big Hypothesis to curvature
      of space and you get curvature of time and the apple falling.&nbsp; See
      Schutz p. 240. He<strong> breaks down gravity into four sources, some of
        which may overlap: one is curvature of time, another curvature of space
      </strong><strong><strong>(which I may be able to show includes the first)</strong>,
        another gravitomagnetism (which I may be able to show also includes the
        first), and feedback/nonlinearity.</strong> It's the last part that
      makes the calculations so bedeviling. </p>
    <p>Here's the secret: the mirrors are made of light too (?). Any time they
      go up and down, they go a little more down and a little less up. That I
      guess I can understand. But every time they go back and forth, they go
      down a little. This I can't quite figure. The geodesic and least action
      principles, which tell us the greatest proper time between events A and B,
      seem unsatisfactory because they treat B as the foregone conclusion and
      the path to get there as the question. Maybe they ought to look at all the
      shortest paths to all the events and then ask which of them is congruent
      to our velocity through A? Yes. See IV-131. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;is electron spin that "inward" radiation/oscillation I have been
      looking for? Don't necessarily specify a mechanism, but somehow mass is
      energy turned into a light clock. Maybe the mirrors are the inside of its
      Schwarzschild radius. E=mc2 -&gt; v=c. the <em>it</em> component of the
      4-vector is in one or more dimensions of space, as a light mirror or
      circle.&nbsp; III-15 Orzel: The kibble is moving through time rather than
      space. "you move through spacetime at exactly the speed of light no matter
      what your speed through space or time is" (more). [So what I am doing is
      showing that "rest mass" really isn't "at rest" at all.]</p>
    <p>But an Orzel-like "Speed through time" is too ambiguous. Do we mean the
      speed of our clock (how much we aged), or how late it got (how much
      everyone else did)? Not just ambiguous, but wrong. Our speed through time
      is <em>literally </em>an aspect of speed through space, and the more we
      speed through space, the more we will find that everyone else has aged
      relative to us (a speed through time).</p>
    <p>reprise (Big Hypothesis): I don't have to show that everything <em>is</em>
      light. All I need to do is <em>describe </em>a system in which this is
      true, and show its complete consistency with relativity. Then I can show <em>why
        </em>time relates to space in the way it does: Why it seems
      independent/orthogonal on a small/slow scale, but is actually
      double-counted, and this must be accounted for on relativistic scales.
      ("How is all mass like a light clock?")</p>
    <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left overs</h4>
    <p>Go over/introduce the earth-moon two-way broadcasting example but do it
      without the gravitational difference. Planet1 and Planet2 are 10 light
      seconds distant; clocks would seem to be in sync if we go halfway between
      the send time and echo back time. But if planet1 clock is brought to
      planet2 for comparison, it will be ten seconds behind; and vice versa. The
      sync IS NOT MEANINGFUL. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Fleisch SGVT p. 184: Sort of like Conway I and II but in reverse? False
      equivalence&nbsp; . . . Is this what Ohanian refers to as (189,90 /
      III-28): "dead wrong"? </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aborted idea</h4>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/light-clock-on-train-experiment.787961/</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Zeno sits on the side of the railroad tracks while Alice passes by on the
      Semiluminal Express, a train that travels at 60 percent of the speed of
      light, with a Lorentz factor of 1.25. Alice's train car has a light clock
      built into it; a mirror stands at each end, facing inward. Alice can time
      light pulses as they are reflected back and forth by the mirrors at the
      speed of light. The train car, and thus the clock, is roughly 40 feet
      long, and each round trip across the clock takes roughly 80 nanoseconds.
      From Zeno's frame of reference, the clock is 32 feet long. But between an
      event at which a single light pulse leaves one mirror and the event at
      which it returns after being reflected back, Zeno measures roughly 100
      nanoseconds over a distance of 100 feet (80 feet in one direction and 20
      in the other, due to the motion of the train). Alice's clock must be
      running slow, he says, to get a shorter elapsed time; and her yardstick
      must be short to measure the clock being longer. </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>But Alice's yardstick <em>is her clock</em>. It runs slower because it
      is shorter. ? Twin Paradox. Yardstick resumes its shape, and clock its
      rate, but both have been places and they are both behind in time.</p>

    <p>One of the strange things about matrices, though, is that their order of
      multiplication matters. The operation associated with position is not the
      same as the one associated with momentum, and the answer you get from the
      multiplication depends on which property you measure first. </p>

    <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curvature of time</h4>
    See Schutz p. 240. He<strong> breaks down gravity into four sources, some of
      which may overlap: one is curvature of time, another curvature of space </strong><strong><strong>(which
        I may be able to show includes the first)</strong>, another
      gravitomagnetism (which is not what I thought it was), and
      feedback/nonlinearity.</strong> It's the last part that makes the
    calculations so bedeviling.&nbsp; Compare Schutz on gravitomagnetism to
    Wheeler 232-33
    <p>Why Things Fall Down, episode 27. A random distribution of uncertain
      electrons will be biased in direction of curved space; revolving (certain)
      electrons will spend more time near this direction. The nucleus will
      follow, and the cycle repeats.</p>
    <p>Schutz (230-)232 Newtonian gravity rewritten as curved (space-)time which
      behaves same as flat Newtonian space. Curvature for the time coordinate
      only. (See also III-58 on Cortan) This is said to account for the
      gravitational redshift, the time rate of the clocks, and the fall of the
      apple. And that would be great, and I wouldn't be tempted to overthink all
      this, if it weren't for the fact that the curvature of space accounts for
      two out of those 3 (until Big H is added). Before the gravitational
      redshift and the slowing clocks, there was just the falling apple. And
      that is the piece I (woudl have been) missing. I never worried about
      explaining electrostatic attraction; I just wanted to show how magnetism
      was just a side-effect of it. It seemed a struggle to do the same with
      Newtonian gravity and GR; they wanted to line up, but only <em>partially</em>.
    </p>
    <p>p. 235 observation shows that deflection is actually twice the value
      given for curved time alone. space must be curved too (compare Ohanian).</p>
    <p>Gravity is like magnetism in some ways but opposite in others. When we
      see relative motion between a charge and current, the magnetic force is
      because of how the charge density has changes from the moving point of
      view. When we release something from rest at some height, it drops not
      because it is already moving, but because there are other frames of
      reference in which it is? Or is it that we only <em>imagine</em> that it
      was at rest, when it was in fact moving back and forth across tiny
      distances? Is that how gravitomagnetism is activated (below)? How would
      that be any different from supposing that it really <em>has</em> no
      precise location and that when it has to keep choosing one at random, the
      odds are biased in favor of the curvature of space?</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the twin particles are far enough apart that gravitational
          gradients must be taken into account, then one cannot safely assume a
          common clock. Clocks are affected by gravity. When Einstein first
          pointed this out, it might have been characterized as "spooky
          timekeeping at a distance." The derivation of Bell's Inequality is
          fairly straightforward if one makes the simplifying assumption of a
          static hidden variable. This is how it is often explained the first
          time around. <strong>But if one then takes up the case of a
            time-varying hidden variable</strong>, this issue of phase-locked
          synchronicity becomes significant. The derivation of Bell's Inequality
          still works if you assume a common clock. But if you admit there is no
          such thing as a common clock for particles separated in space, then
          the math of Bell's derivation runs into difficulties. Mathematically,
          speaking, there arises a residual non-zero "beat frequency" that
          doesn't vanish. Bell managed to get the presumptive hidden variable to
          vanish because he (tacitly) assumed a common clock. Since Bell's
          Inequality doesn't hold in our cosmos, one can interpret that as
          evidence that there is such a thing as "spooky timekeeping at a
          distance." And this phenomenon is well understood to be a feature of
          gravitational gradients. The twin particles do not age in perfect
          phase-locked synchrony, and this throws a monkey wrench into Bell's
          derivation. Bell's Inequality would only hold for a cosmos where there
          are no gravitational gradients. ~Barry Kort <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/2001:470:1F07:BEE:0:0:0:A8"

        <dd>I believe you have raised a valid point. This is why Bell's theorem
          experiments need to be performed. It is not unusual for a successful
          theory to be later shown to be an approximation to a deeper and more
          fundamental theory that is completely different from the original
          theory. If quantum mechanics is wrong, the error likely involves
          gravity. And if the "impossibility" of violating Bell's inequality is
          not quite so impossible, gravity might explain the issue of causality.

        very surprising, since non-locality is normally taken to be prohibited
        by the theory of relativity</em>. " good info on Bell himself and
      excellent dissection of the arguments being made. I think mine is that
      there are "hidden variables" that are determined "non-locally" by
      interactions between a point of entanglement on the one hand and events of
      "measurement" on the other, none of which can be determined to have a
      strict time order in all frames of reference. The key is in the words I
      have highlighted here: "<em>It is a general principle of orthodox
        formulations of quantum theory that measurements of physical quantities
        do not simply reveal <strong>pre-</strong>existing or <strong>pre-</strong>determined
        values, the way they do in classical theories. Instead, the particular
        outcome of the measurement somehow "emerges" from the dynamical
        interaction of the system being measured with the measuring device, so
        that even someone who was omniscient about the states of the system and
        device <strong>prior </strong>to the interaction couldn't have
        predicted <strong>in advance </strong>which outcome would be realized.

      terms. This part is better: "<em>If such measurements are carried out <strong>simultaneously
          </strong>on two spatially-separated particles (<strong>technically, if
          the measurements are performed at space-like separation</strong>) then
        locality requires that any disturbance triggered by the measurement on
        one side cannot influence the result of the measurement on the other
        side. But without any such interaction, the only way to ensure the
        perfect anti-correlation between the results on the two sides is to have

    <p>When we talk about two events that we measure to be simultaneous, we will
      talk about the proper distance we measure between those same events, not
      the proper length of an object spanning the distance between them. That's
      because for spacelike intervals, there IS NO PATH from event A to event B.
      Likewise there may be no "path" between timelike intervals; in some cases,
      we just have to wait. It's the null intervals that the light flows
      between.</p>

    <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The information boundary</h4>
    <p>[If Einstein hadn't told Ford anything, how would the "wave function" of
      probabilities have evolved differently?]</p>
    <p>[Smolin TWP 317/III-73 QM is, per Crane, "a record of information that
      one subsystem of the universe can have about another by virtue of their
      interaction."</p>
    <p>"The collapse of the wavefunction" is information crossing the boundary
      between two systems, e.g. from observed to observer. The information
      boundary is key to both cat stories. In S, the box is the information
      boundary ; that's the premise of the story, that you can't know or measure
      the cat's state without opening the box. In my E's story, the box serves
      no obvious function other than to keep the cat from wandering off. The
      info boundary is the speed of available forms of communication or
      transportation. In a more modern setting, it would be the speed of
      light.(a third cat, p IV-158)</p>
    <p>But what the S. equation may not account for is changes to the
      information boundary, whether it be the opening of the box or the
      expansion of a light sphere. </p>
    <p>IV:152-154 "The collapse of the wavefunction" in Schrodinger's case is
      the act of opening the box, which causes the size and shape of the
      information boundary to evolve over time rather than be confined to the
      same space. In my Einstein's, it's when the cat event's light cone
      intersects with Ford's world line. He just has to wait for it. It evolves
      smoothly with time, just as the S. wave equation does, and as its collapse
      famously refuses to.&nbsp;&nbsp; IV:158 A third experiment</p>

    <p><i>Time Reborn</i> may be the most agitating book I have ever read
      [III:85], because I felt several times that I truly could not tell whether
      Smolin was setting the stage for an answer he is not yet sharing; whether
      I misunderstood the problem as he stated it; or whether – like Lorentz and
      Poincar<span style="color: #0f210b;">é</span> (&lt;- ??? ______________)–
      he had complete mastery of the problem, yet was just shy of seeing – as
      Einstein did – the revolutionary solution. &nbsp;Though much of what he <i>does</i>
      propose as a solution to the dilemma of time goes over my head, I do see
      that he is inclined to consider “a preferred state of rest” and “a
      preferred observer, whose clock measures [a] preferred time,” (p. 165-166)
      and for this reason I have to conclude that one of us is missing an
      important point. He has obviously given this matter a tremendous amount of
      thought and can easily run theoretical and mathematical circles around me,
      but his “parabolic” treatment of the relatively simple matter of <a href="http://bottleofbits.wordpress.com/2013/10/09/three-facts-we-teach-about-gravity-which-are-almost-true-part-one/">elliptical
        non-escaping trajectories</a> &nbsp;gives me great pause. He correctly
      sets up the problem of apparent difference between elliptical orbits and
      parabolic trajectories of falling bodies and shows the relationship of
      these two shapes as conic sections. But then, rather than showing how the
      elliptical trajectory merely <i>approaches</i> a parabolic shape at lower
      velocities (as it also approaches a straight-line drop), he leaves the
      reader with the conclusion that it is actually “parabolas [that] trace the
      paths of falling bodies on Earth,” (p. 21).</p>
    <p>The references Smolin makes are tantalizingly suggestive of my ideas
      above. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">He mentions the study
        of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html">cellular
          automata</a>, a kind of study of cause and effect not unlike what I
        described attempting to do in my computer simulation above. “With only a
        little modification,” he writes, the study of cellular automata is “the
        basis for quantum mechanics.” (<i>Time Reborn</i>, p. 43) </span>In the
      end notes, he again comes close to – but does not touch – the relativistic
      two-body problem: “Consider a system of stars moving under their mutual
      gravitational influence. The interaction of two stars can be described
      exactly; Newton solved that problem. But there is no exact solution to the
      problem of describing the gravitational interaction of three stars.”</p>
    <p>In the above discussion of my computer model, we saw that the initial
      conditions in a finite “span” of spacetime are such that everywhere in it,
      there are light waves carrying information about times preceding the
      “zero” time. The future state of the system is <i>indeterminate</i>
      without that hidden information. &nbsp;Inasmuch as every span of spacetime
      contains information about other spans, it may be seen as analogous to a
      hologram. Suppose we have created a hologram showing an image of a bird.
      One of the remarkable properties of a hologram – related to the fact that
      it allows three-dimensional representations to be made on a
      two-dimensional surface – is that there is no one-to-one correspondence
      between the parts of our bird and the points on the surface of our
      hologram.&nbsp; Each part of the hologram contains information about many
      parts of the bird.</p>
    <p>Holography has special significance in cosmology due to the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">holographic
        principle</a>” developed by Gerard ‘t Hooft. I will not pretend to
      understand it, but as I will show below, it does seem to have more
      connection to my computer modeling problem than just what its name may
      suggest. &nbsp;Wikipedia summarizes the principle thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The holographic principle states that the entropy of <i>ordinary mass</i>
        (not just black holes) is also proportional to surface area and not
        volume; that volume itself is illusory and the universe is really a
        hologram which is isomorphic to the information “inscribed” on the
        surface of its boundary.&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Smolin writes of a “similar idea” proposed by Louis Crane, who suggested
      that</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[Q]uantum mechanics is not a static description of a system but a
        record of information that one subsystem of the universe can have about
        another by virtue of their interaction. He then suggested that there is
        a quantum-mechanical description connected with every way of dividing
        the universe into two parts. The quantum states live not in one part or
        the other but on the boundary between them.</p>
      <p>Crane’s radical suggestion has since grown into a class of approaches
        quantum theory that are called <i>relational quantum theories</i>,
        because they are based on the idea that quantum mechanics is a
        description of relations between subsystems of the universe. This idea
        was developed by Carlo Rovelli, who showed it to be perfectly consistent
        with how we usually do quantum theory.&nbsp; In the context of quantum
        gravity . . .&nbsp; [Fotini] Markapoulou emphasized that describing the
        exchange of information between different subsystems is the same as
        describing the causal structure that limits which systems can influence
        each other. She thus found that a universe can be described as a quantum
        computer, with a dynamically generated logic. (<i>The Trouble With
          Physics</i>, 317-318)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Did you catch that? Relativity is the causal structure which places speed
      limits on the exchange of information from system to system, and quantum
      theory is about describing those systems’ interactions; they seem to be
      different approaches to the same thing. The universe behaves like a
      relativistic quantum computer.</p>

    <p><strong><em></em></strong>In 2013 I worked with computers for a living
      and liked to think about theoretical physics in my spare time. I had some
      interesting thoughts about gravity that I was trying to put into writing.
      In the process of putting the finishing touches on that work, I came
      across some books by Lee Smolin (<i>The Problem With Physics</i> and <i>Time
        Reborn</i>) which excited me tremendously for several reasons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Smolin’s viewpoint on the kind of human diversity that makes physics
        healthy made me feel very good about my role outside academia.</li>
      <li>His questions and observations about the nature of time gave me the
        feeling – rightly or wrongly – that I possessed uncommon insights in an
        important and current area of theoretical physics (many of which you
        have been reading in this book).</li>
      <li>His comments about the absence of uncertainty in general relativity
        and his allusions to particular areas of ongoing research reminded me
        very strongly of a computer program I once tried to write.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is this third item, the computer program, that I will discuss

      propose as a solution to the dilemma of time goes over my head, I do see
      that he is inclined to consider “a preferred state of rest” and “a
      preferred observer, whose clock measures [a] preferred time,” (p. 165-166)
      and for this reason I have to conclude that one of us is missing an
      important point. He has obviously given this matter a tremendous amount of
      thought and can easily run theoretical and mathematical circles around me,
      but his “parabolic” treatment of the relatively simple matter of <a href="http://bottleofbits.wordpress.com/2013/10/09/three-facts-we-teach-about-gravity-which-are-almost-true-part-one/">elliptical
        non-escaping trajectories</a> &nbsp;gives me great pause. He correctly
      sets up the problem of apparent difference between elliptical orbits and
      parabolic trajectories of falling bodies and shows the relationship of
      these two shapes as conic sections. But then, rather than showing how the
      elliptical trajectory merely <i>approaches</i> a parabolic shape at lower
      velocities (as it also approaches a straight-line drop), he leaves the
      reader with the conclusion that it is actually “parabolas [that] trace the
      paths of falling bodies on Earth,” (p. 21).</p>
    <p>The references Smolin makes are tantalizingly suggestive of my ideas
      above. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">He mentions the study
        of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html">cellular
          automata</a>, a kind of study of cause and effect not unlike what I
        described attempting to do in my computer simulation above. “With only a
        little modification,” he writes, the study of cellular automata is “the
        basis for quantum mechanics.” (<i>Time Reborn</i>, p. 43) </span>In the
      end notes, he again comes close to – but does not touch – the relativistic
      two-body problem: “Consider a system of stars moving under their mutual
      gravitational influence. The interaction of two stars can be described
      exactly; Newton solved that problem. But there is no exact solution to the
      problem of describing the gravitational interaction of three stars.”</p>
    <p>In the above discussion of my computer model, we saw that the initial
      conditions in a finite “span” of spacetime are such that everywhere in it,
      there are light waves carrying information about times preceding the
      “zero” time. The future state of the system is <i>indeterminate</i>
      without that hidden information. &nbsp;Inasmuch as every span of spacetime
      contains information about other spans, it may be seen as analogous to a
      hologram. Suppose we have created a hologram showing an image of a bird.
      One of the remarkable properties of a hologram – related to the fact that
      it allows three-dimensional representations to be made on a
      two-dimensional surface – is that there is no one-to-one correspondence
      between the parts of our bird and the points on the surface of our
      hologram.&nbsp; Each part of the hologram contains information about many
      parts of the bird.</p>
    <p>Holography has special significance in cosmology due to the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">holographic
        principle</a>” developed by Gerard ‘t Hooft. I will not pretend to
      understand it, but as I will show below, it does seem to have more
      connection to my computer modeling problem than just what its name may
      suggest. &nbsp;Wikipedia summarizes the principle thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The holographic principle states that the entropy of <i>ordinary mass</i>
        (not just black holes) is also proportional to surface area and not
        volume; that volume itself is illusory and the universe is really a
        hologram which is isomorphic to the information “inscribed” on the
        surface of its boundary.&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Smolin writes of a “similar idea” proposed by Louis Crane, who suggested
      that</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[Q]uantum mechanics is not a static description of a system but a
        record of information that one subsystem of the universe can have about
        another by virtue of their interaction. He then suggested that there is
        a quantum-mechanical description connected with every way of dividing
        the universe into two parts. The quantum states live not in one part or
        the other but on the boundary between them.</p>
      <p>Crane’s radical suggestion has since grown into a class of approaches
        quantum theory that are called <i>relational quantum theories</i>,
        because they are based on the idea that quantum mechanics is a
        description of relations between subsystems of the universe. This idea
        was developed by Carlo Rovelli, who showed it to be perfectly consistent
        with how we usually do quantum theory.&nbsp; In the context of quantum
        gravity . . .&nbsp; [Fotini] Markapoulou emphasized that describing the
        exchange of information between different subsystems is the same as
        describing the causal structure that limits which systems can influence
        each other. She thus found that a universe can be described as a quantum
        computer, with a dynamically generated logic. (<i>The Trouble With
          Physics</i>, 317-318)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Did you catch that? Relativity is the causal structure which places speed
      limits on the exchange of information from system to system, and quantum
      theory is about describing those systems’ interactions; they seem to be
      different approaches to the same thing. The universe behaves like a
      relativistic quantum computer.</p>

    <h3>Chapter ________________________<br>
      Three Things About Gravity Which Are Not Quite True (IV) </h3>
    <a name="ChapterEleventeen">
      <p>[Was he wrong about metric tensor or just too easily misinterpreted?
        You could also say that altitude determines topography]</p>
      <p>This entire chapter is devoted to Michio Kaku, to acknowledge my debt
        to him and express my admiration for him, but also to criticize and poke
        fun at him. In particular, Kaku seems too enthusiastic about the
        possibility of higher dimensions (other than the three we know) making
        science easier to understand; so naturally, this chapter is part four
        (of three) in my "Three Things" series.</p>
      <p>It's been a long journey since I picked up Kaku's <em>Hyperspace </em>in
        the mid 1990s. I scarcely remember when it was, but I still have a pile
        of my personal notes that followed soon after in 1995-1996, full of
        sketches and formulas trying to figure out the meaning of time as a
        fourth dimension. As I reread <em>Hyperspace </em>now, I am reminded
        of how influential on me it was, for both good and bad. It inspired me
        to take a closer look at relativity, and planted the seeds for many of
        the ideas you have been reading here, as well as the ideas, quotations,
        and anecdotes I have taken from Kaku outright. It's an amazing book, and
        very engagingly written. It's also deeply flawed, and I have good reason
        to regret having picked it up at the time I did.</p>
      <p>p. 39 gets it wrong. The metric tensor does not describe curvature at a
        point. Only changes to it do. The metric tensor of a spherical surface
        Gij = [RR, 0, 0, RRsin0sin0] where R=1 and sin0=1, Gij =(1,0,0,1) and
        does not indicate nor remotely suggest curvature, even though the sphere
        has uniform curvature. The <em>derivatives </em>of Gij (Christoffel
        symbols) describe curvature.</p>
      <p>Talking out his ass. Who is this guy?</p>
      <p>p 43 is BAD.</p>
      <p>more, not necessarily about gravity:</p>
      <p>p. 84 "the essence behind the theory of special relativity ... is that
        time is the fourth dimension and that the laws of nature are simplified
        and unified in higher dimensions." Be careful with that word
        "dimension." It's an accounting trick, that's all.</p>
      <p>85: "... if time is the fourth dimension, then it is possible to make
        'rotations' that convert space into time and vice versa." Agreed? But it
        isn't possible, so it's not! <br>

      <p> p. 104 Kaku seems less hostile than I to the idea that science is
        advanced in the way envisioned by "mystics, literati, and the
        avant-garde." They actually get in the way and he is playing their part.

      <h3>Chapter <i>i</i><sup>3</sup><br>
        Imaginary Dimensions</h3>
    </a>
    <p>No discussion of how we came to think of time as a fourth physical
      dimension would be quite complete without some mention of William Rowan
      Hamilton and his invention of a four-dimensional number system called <em>quaternions</em>.
      This chapter should be regarded as an interesting historical footnote
      rather than essential reading. </p>
    <p>Quaternions are Hamilton's extension of the complex plane into three
      dimensions. Although they once played a more important role in physics,
      relatively few people talk about them anymore; they have been replaced in
      some respects by Heaviside's vector calculus and by matrix multiplication.
      The vector calculus formulation of Maxwell's equations, for example; is
      generally considered easier to work with than its quaternion equivalent;
      but for vector transformations in 3D computer graphics, quaternions still
      find use and offer some advantages over matrix operations. </p>
    <p>As noted in previous chapters, complex numbers have the useful property
      of allowing rotations in a plane to be represented by a multiplication
      operation. If we consider any complex number as representing a vector to a
      point in the complex plan from the origin where the real and imaginary
      axes cross, then the product of any complex number multiplied by a
      unit-length complex number<em> e<sup>i</sup></em><sup><em>θ</em></sup> is
      a new vector that has been rotated in the complex plane counterclockwise
      by the angle <em>θ </em>relative to the first vector. </p>
    <p>Hamilton struggled for ten years to invent a number systems that would
      allow rotations in all three dimensions of space instead of just in the
      complex plane. No combination of three real or imaginary numbers was able
      to do this, but four did the trick. Three imaginary numbers were required,
      the product of any two of which would result in the other (or its
      negative), along with one real term. Hamilton famously carved the solution
      into a stone bridge as it came to him in October 1843:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>i</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>j</em><sup>2</sup> =<em> k</em><sup>2</sup>
        = <em>ijk</em> = -1</p>
      <p><strong>Equation iii-1.</strong> Hamilton's quaternion concept, as he
        carved it into Brougham Bridge in Dublin. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>One of the way Hamilton's system lives on today is in the use of the
      letters <em>i</em>, <em>j</em>, and <em>k</em> to represent the basis
      vectors in a three-dimensional Cartesian system. You see, these three
      numbers, according to the rules set by Hamilton, multiply together in the
      same way that vector calculus defines cross products (Chapter
      ______________) of the basis vectors associated with the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>,
      and <em>z</em> directions. The cross product <em>x</em> times <em>y</em>
      is <em>z</em>, and the product of Hamilton's <em>i</em> times <em>j</em>
      is <em>k</em>. In fact, it was Hamilton who first used the term <em>vector
        </em>in the sense that we do today. Like the cross product, the
      multiplication of quaternions is <em>non-commutative</em>, and reversing
      the order of multiplication will change the result. Just as <em>y</em>
      cross <em>x</em> is negative <em>z</em>, <em>j</em> times <em>i</em>
      is negative <em>k</em>. What makes your brain start to hurt a little bit
      is that although all three of these imaginary numbers formed a 3-D space
      analogous to the complex plane and each had its own axis perpendicular to
      the others in that space, what really made quaternions complete was the
      fourth, <em>real </em>part, with its own axis perpendicular to the three
      imaginary parts in a <em>four</em>-dimensional space. Whereas complex
      numbers have parts<em> </em>x<em>+i</em>y, quaternions have parts a+b<em>i</em>+c<em>j</em>+d<em>k</em>.
      Hamilton called quaternions with no real part (a=0) and nonzero imaginary
      parts "vectors." </p>

      First it occurred to me that it isn't whether a 2D manifold <em>has </em>curvature
      but whether we <em>define </em>it that way to make it a sphere rather
      than a plane. But then trying to extend to 3D, I realized that I had to
      ask which kind of space that we live in. Either it circles back on itself
      or it doesn't . Then I realized that in the 2D case, the question of
      sphere or plane is one of <em>topology</em>;&nbsp; Does (x,0,0) connect
      to (x+dx, 0, ct) or to (x+dx, dy, ct)? And <em>then </em>I realized that
      the spacetime metric tells us exactly which is the case, if I can just
      think it through</p>

    <p>A 4-d hypersphere is sort of what you would get if you mapped opposite
      walls to each other and floor to ceiling, but do it in a spherical rather
      than cubic manner? Or maybe TWO spherical volumes with boundaries mapped
      to each other (antipathies!). Follow the analog from 1d/2d circle and
      2d/3d sphere (or toroidal asteroids game?). Don't confuse this curved 3d
      space with the kind we meant earlier! although . . . Fourier</p>

    <p>sphere curvature is uniform. GR does not provide a source for a uniform
      non-zero curvature but does not rule it out either, presumably</p>

      Hamilton spent years working with three terms – one for each dimension of
      space – but could only make them rotate in a plane. When he added the
      fourth, he got the three-dimensional rotation he was looking for, but he
      had trouble conceptualising what this extra term meant. Like most
      Victorians, he assumed this term had to mean something, so in the preface
      to his <i>Lectures on Quaternions</i> of 1853 he added a footnote: “<strong>It
        seemed (and still seems) to me natural to connect this extra-spatial
        unit with the conception of time.</strong>” <strong>Where geometry
        allowed the exploration of space, Hamilton believed, algebra allowed the
        investigation of “pure time”, a rather esoteric concept he had derived
        from Immanuel Kant that was meant to be a kind of Platonic ideal of
        time, distinct from the real time we humans experience.</strong> Other
      mathematicians were polite but cautious about this notion, believing pure
      time was a step too far.</p>
