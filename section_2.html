    <h2>Section Two<br>
    <span class="section-subhead">The End of the World As We Knew It</span></h2>
    <p>Science has overturned our concept of the world many times. We used to
      think the world was flat and that the sun revolved around it (some people
      still do think this). The next several chapters will talk about the
      surprising experiments and revolutionary theories that have most
      fundamentally changed our view of the physical world over the past 120
      years or so, overthrowing the dynasty established by Euclid and ruled over
      most gloriously by Isaac Newton. Modern physics, which emerged in the
      beginning of the twentieth century, held two great surprises for mankind:
      quantum theory and relativity, and these will be the focus of Section Two.</p>

      Mapping The Earth (II)</h3>
    <p>In the previous section, we looked at how the curvature of the earth
      means that systems of measurement that work over small distances begin to
      fall apart or can&apos;t be applied over large distances. We talked a little
      bit about what curvature means, and now it&apos;s time to revisit that. The
      point at which humanity looked beyond Euclidean (flat) geometry to
      describe the surface of the Earth might be considered the first phase in
      the history of what I am calling in this section <q>The End of the World As We Knew It;</q> and non-Euclidean geometry is the foundation of something
      important later in that history, namely general relativity.</p>
    <p>We will take a brief look at curvature in one dimension, which in a
      two-dimensional context might be considered clockwise or counterclockwise,
      up or down. Some types of curvature are more easily understood by looking
      at them in the context of one more dimension. In this chapter we will
      mostly look at two-dimensional curvature, which also comes in two types,
      positive or negative, but has features that you simply can&apos;t have in one
      dimension; a two-dimensional surface can curve into what we see in three
      dimensions as sphere, egg, donut or saddle shapes. We will look at the
      effects of this kind of curvature and how it and its effects can be
      measured. This is all interesting enough in itself, but it will also
      prepare us for a discussion of three-dimensional curvature (Chapter
      Thirty), which is as conceptually different from two-dimensional curvature
      as two-dimensional curvature is from one-dimensional curvature. 
	  Three-dimensional curvature is both positive and negative at the same
      time, but in different aspects. This sounds really abstract, but we will
      get around to visualizing all of it, despite the people who say it can&apos;t
      be done because we can&apos;t conceive a four-dimensional context to place it
      in.</p>

    <p>When we talk about one-dimensional things, we usually talk about <q>lines,</q>
      but not always in the same sense. There is the sense of a <q>line</q> that
      means something that always goes in the same direction and follows the
      shortest distance between any two points on that line, and then there is
      the sense of <q>line</q> as we use it in <q>line drawing:</q> something very thin,
      perhaps infinitesimally thin, that may change direction or <em>curve</em>.
      So in this chapter I will refer to both kinds of lines, but write
      <q>straight lines</q> when I mean the former type.
    </p>

    <p>At any point on a line, that line may curve either toward or away from
      another point not on the line (Figure 17-1). The shorter the distance is
      to that point from the line, the more tightly the line must curve to
      maintain a constant distance from it. In this sense, a circle is curved
      around its center.</p>

    <p>On a Cartesian graph, we might say that a function has positive curvature
      in ranges where its slope increases from left to right (where it points
      more upward), and negative curvature where its slope decreases in that
      direction (where it points more downward). In Figure 17-2, we see the
      graph of a function with positive curvature on both sides and negative
      curvature in the middle. From points A to C, the slope is upward;
      from A to B it gets steeper, but from B to C, that slope decreases until
      it becomes zero and finally goes back downward. B is an inflection point
      where the curvature goes from positive to negative. In calculus terms, we
      would say that the <em>second derivative</em> of this function &mdash; what
      might be called slope of the function&apos;s slope &mdash; changes from positive to
      negative at point B. In the terms we used to describe Figure 17-1, the
      curving line in Figure 17-2 that represents the function is curving around
      a point <em>above</em> it from A to B (and from D to E), and curving
      around a point <em>below</em> it from B to D.</p>
    <p>Two-dimensional surfaces can have a curvature similar to this, if they
      curve radially around a line that serves as an axis. If that radius
      changes only in a linear fashion (or not at all), these surfaces can
      easily be made flat. A cylinder and a cone are the two best examples of
      this: a cylinder has a constant radius around an axis, and though that
      radius changes on a cone, the sides of the cone are straight lines when
      viewed in profile. One simple cut will allow either of these to shapes to
      be unrolled into a flat surface (Figures 17-3 and 17-4). This kind of
      curvature of two-dimensional surfaces is called <q>extrinsic.</q>
      Two-dimensional surfaces may also have an <q>intrinsic</q> curvature; this is
      what is more interesting to us, and what takes us beyond the limits of
      Euclidean geometry.

      A two-dimensional surface may curve at any point on that surface both
      toward <i>and</i> away from a point not on that surface. Such a surface
      is said to have <q>negative curvature.</q> Take the donut-shaped <i>torus</i>
      as an example (Figure 17-5). Part of its surface is negatively curved.
      Choose a point on the torus nearest the center of the torus, and notice
      that the surface of the torus bends <i>toward</i> its center in one
      direction, forming a circle with the center of the torus as its own center
      and enclosing the <q>hole</q> of the donut shape (Figure 17-6). Notice also
      that in a direction perpendicular to the first, the surface bends <i>away</i>
      from the center of the torus, forming a different circle that has a center
      enclosed by the torus itself (Figure 17-7).

      Other examples of negative curvature include the shapes of saddles,
      trumpets, and &mdash; my favorite &mdash; Pringles potato chips. In Figure 17-8 we see
      a two-dimensional surface being transformed between two types of flat
      surfaces: a cylinder and a pair of cones; in between these shapes, the
      surface is negatively-curved in a shape called a <dfn>hyperboloid</dfn>.
      The sides form a hyperbola (Chapter Thirteen), and the geometry of
      negatively-curved surfaces is sometimes called <dfn>hyperbolic</dfn> geometry
      to distinguish it from flat Euclidean geometry.</p>

        geometry of objects like the Earth, tennis balls, and so on. At
      every point on a perfectly spherical object, the surface curves only
      toward the object&apos;s center.

    <p>What these two types of curvature, positive and negative, have in common
      is that the rules of Euclidean geometry do not apply. On such a surface,
      the interior angles of a triangle do not add up to 180 degrees. The
      circumference of a circle is not equal to pi times its diameter. Parallel
      lines do not remain equidistant. Furthermore, this intrinsic curvature
      cannot be eliminated by cutting the surface. If you cut a sphere into
      pieces, none of those pieces will lie flat. This is the reason world maps
      are drawn with distortions or discontinuities; large regions of a curved
      surface cannot be faithfully represented on a flat surface (see Chapter
      Four). Using a globe and a felt pen, a triangle can be drawn with one
      corner at the North Pole and two other corners on the equator, and with
      each of the three interior angles being 90 degrees, for a total of 270
      degrees rather than the 180 degrees demanded by Euclid (Figure 4-5,
      Chapter Four). Even smaller areas of the Earth have curvature which can be
      measured in this manner.

    <p>We tend to think of curved two-dimensional surfaces as being <q>embedded</q>
      in a three-dimensional space. It&apos;s easier to visualize them this way, but
      that third dimension is not an intrinsic property of the space, and need
      not necessarily exist. By the same token, it&apos;s one thing to look at
      two-dimensional curvature from the outside, like examining a globe; it&apos;s
      quite another thing to notice it from the inside. For century after
      century, it was known that the earth was round, and yet Euclid&apos;s geometry
      worked just fine, because no one was taking highly accurate measurements
      over very large distances.</p>
    <p>It is thought that on a geographic survey commissioned in 1827, the
      mathematician Karl Gauss noted that over great distances, the surface of
      the Earth did not follow the rules of geometry established millennia
      before by Euclid. Specifically, John Wheeler writes,  <q>[Gauss] found that the sum of the angles in his largest survey triangle was less than 180 degrees;</q> this was 
       <q>both inescapable evidence for and a measure of the curvature of the Earth.</q> Even then, the difference observed by Gauss was
      only 1/240<sup>th</sup> of a degree, so the fact that he even took notice
      might also be considered a measure of his own confidence and competence.
      <!-- (Wheeler, pp. 4-5)-->James Hartle, in <cite>Gravity</cite>,
      <!--p. 15-->gives more details regarding Gauss&apos; legendary survey while
      cautioning the reader that the <q>historical evidence is not conclusive</q>
      that it took place. Though dramatizing this development would make for a
      great story, like Newton&apos;s supposed epiphany while observing the fall of
      an apple, Gauss would have been well prepared for such a discovery.</p>
    <p>For many years, Gauss had begun working on non-Euclidean geometry without
      having published anything on it. Others who had similar thoughts began
      publishing them soon afterward, not only beating Gauss to the press but
      also writing about hyperbolic geometries like that which Gauss himself was
      considering, and which were likewise quite different from what anyone
      would notice on the spherical surface of the earth. Russian mathematician
      Nikolai Lobachevsky was the first to publish in 1830, followed closely by
      the Hungarian János Bolyai in 1832. In 1853, Gauss asked his student
      Bernhard Riemann to prepare a presentation on <q>the foundation of geometry</q>
      in hopes he could further develop alternatives to it.<!--(Kaku, p. 34)-->
      Riemann succeeded beyond his mentor&apos;s hopes, announcing the next year that
      not only was there a system for mathematically describing the curvature of
      a non-Euclidean space at any point, but that this system could be extended
      to an arbitrary number of dimensions. A handful of numbers could describe
      the curvature of three-dimensional space and not many more would describe
      four.
      <!-- (Wheeler 6)--></p>
    <p>Anticipating Einstein&apos;s work by more than half a century, Riemann
      explored non-Euclidean geometry as the explanation for the invisible
      forces of gravity, electricity, and magnetism. Rather than being satisfied
      with Newton&apos;s <q>action at a distance,</q> Riemann saw that these forces could
      be explained as properties of space itself. But lacking the field
      equations later developed by Einstein and Maxwell, this ambition was
      unrealized in his lifetime.
      <!--(Kaku, pp. 36-37, 42-43)--></p>
    <p>Riemann&apos;s 1854 lecture <q>On the Hypotheses Which Underlie Geometry</q>
      proposed a <q>family</q> of non-Euclidean geometries, of which spherical
      geometry is just one. It was published posthumously twelve years later;
      Riemann died in 1863. Arthur Cayley is credited with initiating the study
      of elliptic (or spherical) geometry in his 1859 writing  <q>On the definition of distance.</q><!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry--> It
      seems strange that scholarship on the geometry of spheres, like the Earth,
      actually lagged behind the much less intuitive geometry of negative
      curvature, on which papers had been published decades earlier.</p>

    <p>I hope you will permit me a few more paragraphs on hyperbolic geometry
      before we return to the more familiar geometry of spheres and an
      overview of how the math works. I promise to make it fun. We saw in
      Chapter Four that there are challenges in representing a positively-curved
      surface on a flat one, and that there are different projection methods for
      doing so. Similar challenges exist in representing a negatively-curved
      surface, and I&apos;d like to show two different projection methods here.
      Whereas spheres tend to come back and meet themselves after curving around
      a single point, this isn&apos;t true of all curved surfaces; they aren&apos;t
      necessarily <em>finite</em>. So the methods of projection tend to take
      this into account, and represent all directions of infinity as a fixed
      distance from any given point, in much the same way that the horizon line
      and its vanishing points represent an infinite distance in panoramic
      photos and perspective drawings (See Figure 17-13 and Chapter Three).

    <p>In Figure 17-14, we see what is called the Beltrami-Klein projection
      model of a negatively-curved space. Like the Mercator projection of the
      spherical surface of the Earth, this projection also has its unavoidable
      distortions. Lines are shown as lines, but angles are not accurate. We see
      that lines which are not parallel do not necessarily meet, even at the
      infinite distances represented at the circular boundary of the model; this
      would be impossible in a Euclidean space, but it is one of the defining
      characteristics of hyperbolic geometry.

    <p>An alternative to the Beltrami-Klein model is the Poincar&eacute;  disk (Figures
      17-15 and 17-16), which has some amusing properties. In this model,
      straight lines appear curved, but angles and circles are preserved. All
      lines must meet the boundary, which represents an infinite distance, at
      right angles; this has the result that any line not passing through the
      center will be curved.

    <p>Henri Poincar&eacute; (1854-1912) was on the leading edge of scientific thought
      during his time and under slightly different circumstances might well have
      arrived at a theory of relativity before Einstein. In 1905, he described a
      world much like the one represented in the Poincar&eacute; disk; this description
      was both reminiscent of Riemann&apos;s efforts to explain the universe&apos;s
      fundamental forces in terms of geometry and anticipatory of Einstein&apos;s
      completion of what Riemann had begun:</p>
    <blockquote>
        Suppose, for example, a world enclosed in a large sphere and
        subject to the following laws: The temperature is not uniform; it is
        greatest at their centre, and gradually decreases as we move towards the
        circumference of the sphere, where it is absolute zero. The law of this
        temperature is as follows: If <i>R</i> be the radius of the sphere, and
        <i>r</i> the distance of the point considered from the centre, the
        absolute temperature will be proportional to <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>r</i><sup>2</sup>.
        Further, I shall suppose that in this world all bodies have the same
        co-efficient of dilatation, so that the linear dilatation of any body is
        proportional to its absolute temperature. Finally, I shall assume that a
        body transported from one point to another of different temperature is
        instantaneously in thermal equilibrium with its new environment. &hellip; If
        they construct a geometry, it will not be like ours, which is the study of
        the movements of our invariable solids; it will be the study of the
        changes of position which they will have thus distinguished, and will be
        <q>non-Euclidean displacements,</q> and this will be non-Euclidean geometry. So
        that beings like ourselves, educated in such a world, will not have the
        same geometry as ours.
    </blockquote>
    <p>So let&apos;s talk now about how we make measurements and detect curvature in
      our world. We have mentioned a few measurable effects of curvature
      already: whether parallel lines converge or diverge; how many degrees are
      in the sum of the angles of a triangle; and the ratio of a circle&apos;s 
      circumference to its radius. There is also the <q>parallel transport</q> issue
      mentioned in Chapter Four, before we had really talked about vectors. As
      we saw in Chapter Eight (Figure 8-9) with the moving billiard ball
      vectors, to add vectors at different locations, you have to move them
      together, taking care to keep their components the same, or in other
      words, keeping them parallel throughout the move. That is why we call it
      <q>parallel transport.</q> All of these effects are measurable from <em>within
    </em>  the space; one doesn&apos;t need, for example, to look at the globe from
      the outside to measure the curvature of the Earth, nor does one need to
      have a direct measurement of the Earth&apos;s radius.</p>
    <p>For a practical example of how this works, let&apos;s imagine ourselves at the
      north pole with Alice and Zeno. By the way, in elliptic geometry, a <em>pole
      </em>  has a meaning closely related to the one we know. Every straight
      line has at least one pole where all lines perpendicular to that line will
      meet, so any pole is defined in relation to a line. In the case of the
      north and south poles, that line is the equator. All lines of longitude
      cross the equator at right angles, meeting at both of these poles. Lines
      of latitude parallel to the equator do not meet, not because they are
      straight but because they curve around the nearest pole.</p>
    <p>With that said, let&apos;s imagine that Alice has driven a stake into the ice
      at the north pole, around which she has tied a rope; and that there is
      sufficient ice all around her to walk a great distance in any direction
      from the pole. She remains at the pole with a radio while Zeno uncoils the
      rope and pulls it tight. Together, they make measurements. To make the
      differences in these measurements easier to notice, let&apos;s also suppose
      that the Earth is much smaller than it really is, and that it curves much
      more tightly around its center. The rope is marked at equal intervals to
      help Zeno measure its length. With one length of rope uncoiled, which is
      quite long, he walks in a direction perpendicular to the rope and measures
      how far he walks until he hears from Alice on his radio that he has walked
      one tenth of the circumference of a circle, which Alice has measured by
      watching the changing angle of the rope on the stake. Zeno radios back
      with the distance he has walked, which happens to be sixty one hundredths
      of a rope length. They each write down <q>1</q> and 
      then <q>0.61</q> Zeno uncoils
      another length of the rope and heads back in the opposite direction,
      measuring the distance he walks until Alice radios again and tells him
      that he has walked the same angular distance. Zeno reports that this walk
      was equal to 1.19 rope lengths. They each write down <q>2</q> 
      under the <q>1</q> and
      then <q>1.19</q> under 
      the <q>0.61</q> On the third pass, with three rope lengths,
      the distance of his walk is 1.74 rope lengths.</p>

    <p>Alice looks at her table of measurements, and notices two things. First,
      Zeno&apos;s walks get longer for every length of rope that he is away from the
      pole. That makes sense, because the circumference of a circle grows in
      direct proportion to its radius, and Zeno has been walking a constant
      tenth of a full circle around the pole. But the second thing that she will
      notice, if their measurements are accurate enough, and their rope is long
      enough in relation to the curvature of the Earth, is that for each
      successive rope length between Zeno and the pole, his walks gain a little
      less distance each time. At one rope length of radius, Zeno&apos;s walking
      distance was 0.61 lengths. At two lengths, the distance was only an
      additional 0.58 lengths. At a radius of three lengths, Zeno only gained an
      additional 0.55 lengths in his walk. This decreasing incremental distance
      tells Alice that the surface they are measuring has positive curvature.</p>
    <p>If Alice and Zeno were at liberty to fly high above the earth, they would
      be able to see the reason why their measurements of walking distance are
      increasing more slowly at greater distances. If Zeno were to have walked
      to the equator, his walking distance would have reached its maximum; and
      at greater radial distances after that, his walking distance would have
      actually grown shorter. If Zeno were able to make it all the way to the
      opposite side of the earth, still holding the rope tight and connected to
      the north pole, he would find that he had been walking around the south
      pole as well as (or rather than?) the north, until he reached the south
      pole and his walking distance became nearly zero.</p>
    <p>If we establish a (naturally) polar coordinate system with the north pole
      as its origin, calling the length of the rope the radius <i>r</i> and
      the direction of the rope the angle <i>&theta;</i>, we can generalize Alice
      and Zeno&apos;s table of measurements into something called a <q>metric</q> of the
      Earth&apos;s surface. At every point on that surface, there is not only an <i>r</i>
      for its radial distance from the pole and a <i>&theta;</i> for its
      direction, these being the <em>coordinates</em> of the point; but there
      is also a distance <i>s</i> associated with every successive linear
      distance <i>r</i>, and another distance <i>s</i> associated with
      every successive angular distance <i>&theta;</i>. These last two numbers are
      the <em>metric</em> for that point. At the coordinates <span class="row_vector">[0,0]</span>, that
      metric is <span class="row_vector">[1.00, 0]</span>; in other words, there is only one direction from the
      pole, and that direction is <em>outward</em>. The numbers mean this: if
      Alice or Zeno goes one rope length in the <i> r</i>  direction (in this
      case, any direction, since we are at the origin), he or she will have gone
      one rope length (of course). If they confine themselves to moving only in
      the <i>&theta;</i> direction, they will only be rotating in place, so they
      will have gone no distance at all. Polar coordinates aren&apos;t really the
      best system to use <em>at</em> the pole, but they work very well <em>near
      </em>  it. At any other point, the numbers are different. At the
      coordinates <span class="row_vector">[1,0]</span>, 
	  the metric becomes <span class="row_vector">[1.00, 0.017]</span>. The number 0.017 is
      the 0.61 lengths of walking distance divided by the 36 degrees of angle
      that Zeno&apos;s walk traversed at a radius of one length. In other words, for
      every rope length Zeno travels in the <i> r</i>  direction from that
      point, he will have gone (&hellip; wait for it &hellip;) one rope length. But for
      every degree he travels in the <i>&theta;</i> direction, he will have gone a
      distance <i>s</i> of 0.017 rope lengths. Alice and Zeno will find that
      the metric does not change for increasing or decreasing <i>&theta;</i> coordinates,
      but only for increasing or decreasing <i>r</i> coordinates. So at the
      coordinates <span class="row_vector">[1,0]</span> 
	  or at <span class="row_vector">[1, <i>&theta;</i>]</span> for any value of <i>&theta;</i>, the
      metric will be <span class="row_vector">[1.00, 0.017]</span>. 
	  At the coordinates <span class="row_vector">[2,0]</span> 
	  (or at <span class="row_vector">[2, <i>&theta;</i>]</span>
      for any value of <i>&theta;</i>), the metric will be <span class="row_vector">[1.00, 0.033]</span>. The <i>r</i>
      metric is of course unchanged, because it is a linear measurement. But at
      <span class="row_vector">[2, 0]</span> the <i>&theta;</i> metric is a little less than twice what it was at
      the point <span class="row_vector">[1, 0]</span> (Table 17-2).

    <p>If we assign a metric to every point on this surface (or any other) in
      this way, we can do more precise quantitative analyses on this metric and
      use calculus to talk about the ratios of tiny differential changes <i> dr
    </i>   and <i>d&theta;</i> in coordinates <i>r</i> and <i>&theta;</i> to tiny
      differential changes <i>ds</i> in the metric. More importantly, we can
      talk about how those ratios <i>ds</i>/<i>dr</i> and <i>ds</i>/<i>d&theta;</i>
      themselves change over tiny increases <i>dr</i> in the distance <i>r</i>   
      (or in any other coordinate). If these ratios change, then we know
      that the surface is curved. In calculus, these tiny changes in ratio are
      called the <em>second derivatives</em> (<i>d</i><i><sup>2</sup>s</i>/<i>dr</i><sup>2</sup>
      and <i>d</i><i><sup>2</sup>s</i>/<i>d&theta;</i><sup>2</sup>)
      of the metric with respect to the coordinate system. They are more precise
      and smaller-scale descriptions of the same changes that we noticed. For
      more on calculus, see Chapter Eleven if you skipped over it.</p>
    <p>Speaking of which, if you did skip over Chapter Eleven, you may prefer to
      skip over the remainder of this chapter, and that is perfectly all right.
      We&apos;re going to go over some more technical details that really aren&apos;t
      necessary for enjoying the chapters to follow, but if you really do want
      to learn the math, then the rest of this chapter will be really helpful.
      This will be the material I wish I would have had when I was struggling to
      make sense of what is called <dfn>differential geometry</dfn>.</p>
    <h4>The metric tensor in two-dimensional polar coordinate systems</h4>
    <p>Wow, that chapter sub-heading is a mouthful, isn&apos;t it? Have I scared you
      off yet? No? Good.</p>
    <p>I should point out that from here on, when I talk about angles, I will
      mean measurements in radians rather than degrees, unless I write
      <q>degrees.</q> Quantities like arc length are simpler to calculate in radians;
      the length is simply the radius <i>r</i> times the angle <i>&theta;</i>
      rather than <i>r</i> times <i>&theta;</i> times &pi;/180. I will also on
      occasion use the <q>*</q> character to indicate 
      multiplication when the <q>x</q>
      character might be mistaken to mean the wrong thing, such as a vector
      cross-product (Chapter Eleven).</p>
    <p>In a two-dimensional polar coordinate system, Alice and Zeno were able
      to demonstrate curvature using only two numbers for the metric because the
      lines of constant <i>r</i> and <i>&theta;</i> are perpendicular (or <em>orthogonal</em>)
      at every point on the surface. This <em>orthogonality</em> is what makes
      the variables <i>r</i> and <i>&theta;</i>  independent. There could be
      other coordinate systems in which this isn&apos;t so, and in such cases more
      numbers are needed for the metric, to describe how the variables depend on
      each other. But the polar coordinate system tends to break down at the
      pole itself, where the lines of constant <i>&theta;</i> all cross one
      another, because they are not parallel at most points on the surface.
      Later in this chapter we will discuss a Cartesian coordinate system on a
      spherical surface that has the surprising property of its <i>x</i> and
      <i>y</i> coordinates not being entirely independent; it will have lines
      of constant <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> that eventually cross one another.
      The fact that coordinate systems such as these have to be accounted for is
      why we have something called the <dfn>metric tensor</dfn>. Let&apos;s hold off
      for a moment on the question of what a tensor is in general. The metric
      tensor is an invention of Riemann&apos;s which, like the metric, tells us about
      distances surrounding any point in a coordinate system. John Wheeler calls
      it a machine for calculating the real distance between any to points in a
      given system. You feed it pairs of coordinates, and it gives you a
      distance.<!--(Ohanian 194) -->The difference between the metric tensor and
      the metric as we have described it so far is that the metric tensor is a
      two-dimensional array of numbers rather than just a single pair. This is,
      again, because we will need a generalized system that can handle
      non-orthogonal coordinate axes. So at the point <span class="row_vector">[1, 0]</span>, where our metric
      is <span class="row_vector">[1.00, 0.017]</span>. the metric tensor looks like this:

	  The zero elements (upper right and lower left) in Figure 17-19 are where
      we would see nonzero values in cases where our two coordinate axes were
      not orthogonal and independent. We will have such an example later on.
	</p>
    <p>Now let&apos;s talk about what <dfn>tensor</dfn> means. A tensor is an idea
      that includes, and expands on, the ideas of scalars and vectors. A scalar,
      you will recall, is a single quantity having no direction associated with
      it; we call this a tensor of <q>rank zero.</q> A vector is a quantity with an
      associated direction, so a vector will have as many numbers as there are
      dimensions in the space it is associated with. A two-dimensional vector
      will typically have <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components in a Cartesian
      system and <i>r</i> and <i>&theta;</i> components in a polar system. We
      can call a vector a tensor of <dfn>rank one</dfn>. To reiterate: no
      directions, rank zero; one direction, rank one. The metric tensor is a
      tensor of <dfn>rank two</dfn>, and as such it can represent the
      relationships between multiple <em>pairs</em> of directions: for
      example, between the components of the coordinate system.</p>
    <p>The elements of a tensor are indexed by which components they represent.
      A rank one tensor, what we more commonly call a vector, has one index, and
      one element for each of the coordinates in the coordinate system. Let&apos;s 
      recall Figure 8-10 for some concrete examples.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>a</b> = <span class="row_vector">[1,-1]</span></p>
        <p><b>b</b> = <span class="row_vector">[1, 1]</span></p>
        <p><b>c</b> = <span class="row_vector">[2, 0]</span></p>
        <p><b>Figure 8-10</b>. The components <span class="row_vector">[<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>]</span>
          of the vectors <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b>.
          As discussed below, these components might also be named <span class="row_vector">[<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub> ]</span>.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In Figure 8-10, above, we have some vectors with <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
      components. As we consider vectors more generally as examples of tensors,
      it sometimes becomes more convenient to <em>number</em> the components
      of the vector than to assign them various <em>letters</em>. So in place
      of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, we might have <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> and
      <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, or even &epsilon;<sub>1</sub> and &epsilon;<sub>2</sub>. The
      subscripted number in either of these cases is the component <em>index</em>.
      We could say of the vector <b>a</b> in Figure 8-10 that its <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>
      component is 1 and <i>x</i><sub>2</sub> component is -1.</p>
    <p>A rank two tensor has two indices, one for a row in the tensor, and
      another index for a column; and a metric tensor has one element for every
      <em>combination</em> of the coordinates in the coordinate system. Skip
      ahead a little bit and look at the metric tensor <i>G</i> in Figure
      17-22. It has four elements, G<sub>11</sub>, G<sub>12</sub>, G<sub>21</sub>,
      and G<sub>22</sub>. G<sub>11</sub> and G<sub>12</sub> are the top row (1
      and 0), the topmost elements in each column, as specified by the first
      index having the value of one. G<sub>21</sub> and G<sub>22</sub> are
      the bottom row (0 and 1), as specified by the first index having the value
      of two.</p>
    <p>In general, we can read the elements of a metric tensor using a sort of key
    like one of the following:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/t2neg.jpg" style="max-height: 100px;">

      <p><b>Figure 17-20</b>. A key for the indices of metric
        tensors in terms of <i>r</i> and <i>&theta;</i>.<br>

        in terms of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The first index in each tensor will specify a row in that tensor. In
      Figure 17-20 these are the <i>r</i> and <i>&theta;</i> rows; in Figure
      17-21 these are the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> rows. The second index in
      each tensor will specify a column in that tensor. In Figure 17-20 these
      are the <i>r</i> and <i>&theta;</i> columns; in Figure 17-21 these are
      the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> columns. Bear with me a moment longer,
      and we&apos;ll start to see how this all comes together with what we have been
      talking about.</p>
    <p>Metric tensors help us in calculating distance in a way that closely
      relates to the Pythagorean theorem. We are most familiar with this theorem
      in a form something like <i>c</i><sup>2 </sup>= <i>a</i><sup>2
      </sup>+ <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>, which describes the relationship
      between the sides of a right triangle, but we have also seen it in the
      form <i>s</i><sup>2 </sup>= <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup>,
      which describes the sum of two orthogonal vectors in a Cartesian
      coordinate system and in flat Euclidean space. We could rewrite this as <i>s</i><sup>2
      </sup>= <i>x*x</i><sup> </sup>+ <i>y*y</i>, and then more
      generally as <i>s</i><sup>2 </sup>= 1(<i>x*x</i>)<sup> </sup>+ 0(<i>x</i>*<i>y</i>)
      + 0(<i>y*x</i>)+ 1(<i>y*y</i>) to show every possible pairing of <i>x</i>
      and <i>y</i>. Then, using the index key in Figure 17-21, we could place
      each of the zero and one coefficients (multipliers) into a metric tensor:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/tensor4.png" style="max-height: 100px;">

        Euclidean space in Cartesian coordinates (also known in linear algebra
        as the identity matrix).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So now, courtesy of Bernhard Riemann, we have a very robust system for
      describing distances in any coordinate system, flat or curved, orthogonal
      or not. We could take the metric tensor in Figure 17-19 and the index key
      in Figure 17-20 and use them to calculate distances near the coordinates
      it is associated with. For every small <i>dr</i> and <i>d</i><i>&theta;</i>,
      we would calculate the distance <i>ds</i> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>ds</i><sup>2 </sup>= 1.00(<i>dr*dr</i>)<sup> </sup>+ 0(<i>dr*d</i><i>&theta;</i>)
        + 0(<i>d</i><i>&theta;</i><i>*dr</i>)+ 0.017(<i><i>d</i><i>&theta;</i>*</i><i>d</i><i>&theta;</i>)</p>
      <p><b>Equation 17-1.</b>  <span class="equation_description">Calculating a small distance using the
        metric tensor in Figure 17-19.</span>
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Of course, over distances which are large enough to be accompanied by a
      significant change in the metric, we will have to take those changes in
      the metric into account as well, and that involves integral calculus which
      will tell us how the distance <i>s</i> accumulates over all the
      incremental changes. This takes us into a subject area called differential
      geometry.</p>
    <p>Though I think it&apos;s a good idea to show specific examples, it isn&apos;t often
      that you will find specific metric tensor values for specific coordinate
      values in introductory texts. More often, you will see tensors populated
      by variables that apply over an entire surface. For example, the metric
      tensor of a flat surface in polar coordinates can be written this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/tensor5.png" style="max-height: 100px;">
     <br> <b>Figure 17-23</b> . The metric tensor for flat
        Euclidean space in polar coordinates.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Using this metric, we calculate that <i>ds</i><sup>2</sup> (the square
      of the distance <i>ds</i>) is <b><span style="color: #3515f4;">1</span></b> (<i>dr</i><sup>2</sup>)
      + <b style="color: #7b7778;">0</b> (<i>dr*d&theta;</i>) + <b
        style="color: #7b7778;">0</b> (<i>d&theta;*dr</i>) +<b><span
          style="color: #3515f4;"> <i>r</i><sup>2</sup></span></b> (<i>d&theta;</i><sup>2</sup>)
      = <i>dr</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>r</i><sup>2</sup><i>d&theta;</i><sup>2</sup>.
      In other words, for very small values of <i>&theta;</i>, the distance <i>s</i>
	  approximates the vector addition of the distance <i>dr</i> and the
      arc length <i>r*d&theta;</i>. For larger values of <i>&theta;</i>, it gets
      more complicated and involves calculus again, because (for example) the
      direction of <i>d&theta;</i> changes as <i>&theta;</i> itself changes. If you
      dive deep enough in the math of it all, you will hear this aspect of it
      referred to as <em>changes in the basis vectors</em>. See Chapter
      Nineteen for more on this.</p>
    <p>For example, imagine we are standing at the north pole and that our
      coordinate system is such that <i>&theta;</i> is zero degrees longitude at
      our right hand, 90 degrees in front of us, 180 degrees at our left hand,
      and so on. In terms of places these longitude lines would pass near, we
      would have London far off to our right, Krasnoyarsk in front of us, and
      the Bering Strait and Aleutian Islands to our left (Figure 17-24). So, at
      a radius of one meter, and at <i>&theta;</i>=0, to our right, imagine there
      is a vector (red) pointing counterclockwise, in the direction of
      increasing <i>&theta;</i>. If that vector were moved (or <dfn>parallel
        transported</dfn>) to be right next to us, it would point the same way
      that we are facing, towards Krasnoyarsk. In fact, right where it sits it
      is still pointing in the general direction of Krasnoyarsk. Also at a
      radius of one meter, directly in front of us, there is another vector
      (orange), also pointing in the direction of increasing <i>&theta;</i>; this
      one points in the direction of the Bering Strait. There is a third vector
      (purple) that we can add to the first one to get the second one, and that
      third vector points in the direction of minus <i>r</i> (the three
      vectors are brought together at lower left to show that the red and
      purple vectors add to make the orange one). In other words, as we move in
      the direction of increasing <i>&theta;</i>, the vector <i>d&theta;</i> changes,
      and this change is in the direction of decreasing <i>r</i>. If you
      repeat this exercise, you will find that as we move in the direction of
      increasing <i>&theta;</i>, the vector <i>dr</i> also changes, and this
      change is in the direction of increasing <i>&theta;</i>; as
      we move in the direction of increasing <i>r</i>, the vector <i>d&theta;</i> changes, and this change is in the direction of increasing <i>&theta;</i>.</p>

    <p>If you think this is all terribly complicated, you&apos;re absolutely right.
      And the math is pretty ugly, which is why our exploration of it will be
      somewhat superficial here. But here&apos;s a table of what we have covered so

    <p>Before we move on to Cartesian systems, let&apos;s have an example of a
      generalized metric of a curved space. The metric for the surface of a
      sphere can be written this way, in terms of the sphere&apos;s radius <i>R</i>
      and the longitude <i>&phi;</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/tensor6.png" style="max-height: 100px;"><img

          class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/spherical-metric.png" style="max-height: 300px;">

        in terms of the sphere&apos;s radius <i>R</i> and the longitude <i>&phi;</i>.
       </p> </blockquote>
    <p>Using this metric, we calculate that <i>ds</i><sup>2</sup> (the square
      of the distance <i>ds</i>) is <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>(<i>dr</i><sup>2</sup>)
      + 0(<i>dr*d&theta;</i>) + 0 (<i>d&theta;*dr</i>) + <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i>cos&phi;</i><sup>2</sup>(<i>d&theta;</i><sup>2</sup>)
      = <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i>dr</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>R</i><sup>2</sup><i>cos</i><i>&phi;</i><sup>2</sup><i>d&theta;</i><sup>2</sup>.
      The lower the longitude is, the greater the distance involved in moving
      one degree of latitude (Figure 17-26). But again, this calculation is only
      approximate over small changes in <i>r</i> and <i>&theta;</i> due to <i>dr</i>
      and <i>d</i><i>&theta;</i> being subject to changes in their
      direction. For example, if we want to know the shortest distance between
      two points at opposite ends of a half-circle (which would be a large value
      of <i>&theta;</i>), we would want the result to equal the diameter
      of the circle, 2<i>r</i>, not the arc length <i>r&theta;</i> between
      two opposite sides. To make sure we account for the changing <em>basis</em> of
      <i>&theta;</i>, we would use calculus, and we will be saving those details
      for another chapter if not for another book altogether.</p>
    <h4>The metric tensor in other two-dimensional coordinate systems</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>For our next imaginary trip, we shall go with Alice and Zeno to the
      equator. Like our imaginary trip to the north pole, let&apos;s imagine a place
      with flat terrain where we can see long distances in all directions; and
      let us again suppose that the Earth is much smaller than it really is, so
      that its curvature will be more obvious in our measurements. Alice and
      Zeno will try to establish a Cartesian coordinate system with the equator
      as their <i>x</i> axis, and an arbitrary line of constant longitude for
      their <i>y</i> axis. They begin taking measurements. Zeno marches ten
      kilometers in the positive <i>x</i> direction, and then makes a
      90-degree turn and marches ten kilometers in the positive <i>y</i>
      direction (the red path in Figure 17-27). He might wish to give the
      coordinates <span class="row_vector">[10, 10]</span> to this location, but just to check his measurements,
      he and Alice have agreed that they will meet by taking two different
      paths: Alice marches from the origin point ten kilometers in the positive
      <i>y</i> direction and then makes a 90-degree turn and marching ten
      kilometers in the positive <i>x</i> direction (the blue path in Figure
      17-27). What they find is that Alice&apos;s trip ends at a different point from
      Zeno&apos;s , just a little shorter in the <i>y</i> direction and a little
      more in the <i>x</i> direction; whereas Alice finds that Zeno&apos;s trip
      ends a little bit short in the <i>x</i> direction and went a little
      too far in the <i>y</i> direction. But no matter how many times they
      repeat the exercise, even if they switch roles, they find that each path
      ends in its particular location, which is different from the other.</p>
    <p>In mathematical terms, we might say that the actions of going ten
      kilometers in the <i>x</i> direction and going ten kilometers in the <i>y</i>
      direction do not <em>commute</em>; done in different order, they produce
      a different result. This idea of commutativity will be important later on,
      and is one of the surprises of quantum mechanics. As far as concerns Alice
      and Zeno here, the difference between the results of their
      differently-ordered paths is illustrative of something called a <dfn>commutator
	  </dfn>or Lie bracket  (<q><b>lee</b> bracket</q>)<!--see 6:20 in this eigenchris video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3h9w9ldaA-->,
      which are terms you may encounter in discussions of curved geometry,
      general relativity, or quantum mechanics.</p>
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <p>It may seem as though some trick of the landscape is causing Alice and
      Zeno to lose their way, so they return to the origin and start working on
      building grid lines. They march one kilometer along the <i>x</i> axis,
      then turn 90 degrees and march in the <i>y</i> direction, driving red
      survey markers into the ground at each successive kilometer. They return
      to the origin, march <em>two</em> kilometers along the <i>x</i> axis,
      then turn 90 degrees and march in the <i>y</i> direction, again
      driving red survey markers into the ground at each successive kilometer.
      They repeat the process until they have placed one hundred red survey
      markers. Then they take measurements again, and find two complications.
      The first is that the markers of equal <i>y</i> distance (other than
      the ones on the <i>x</i> axis) do not exactly lie on straight lines, as
      the markers of equal <i>x</i> distance do If they walk in the direction
      of increasing <i>x</i> along all of the <i>y</i>=10 markers from
      <i>x</i>=0 to <i>x</i>=10, they have to turn a little to their left
      after each marker to go in the direction of the next one. This makes the
      coordinate system <em>curvilinear</em> rather than Cartesian.</p>
    <p>The second complication is that the distance between the markers of equal
      <i>y</i> distance at <i>x</i>=0 and <i>x</i>=10 get closer
      together for every increasing measurement of <i>y</i>, and this is true
      (though perhaps less noticeable) for any two values of <i>x</i> , not
      just zero and ten. If Alice and Zeno were to draw lines between these
      markers of equal <i>y</i> distance, we could call them latitude lines,
      because they are always a fixed distance from their <i>x</i> axis, the
      equator. And as we saw in Chapter Four, the further we go from the
      equator, the more obvious it is that these latitude lines curve around the
      pole rather than making a great circle around the circumference of the
      Earth. It also becomes more obvious that the lines perpendicular to the
      equator, the lines of constant <i>x</i> which we could call longitude
      lines, grow closer together with distance from the equator, eventually
      meeting at the poles.</p>

        placed by measuring equal distances on lines perpendicular to the <i>x</i>
        axis.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If Alice and Zeno were so inclined, they could repeat the process,
      placing blue survey markers at equal distances along straight lines from
      the <i>y</i> axis, and they would have similar results. They would
      find that their blue markers of equal <i>x</i> distance (other than the
      ones on the <i>y</i> axis) did not lie on a straight line, and grew
      closer together for increasing values of <i>x</i>. Rather than being
      lines of latitude, the straight lines they follow from the <i>y</i>
      axis would be great circles that would eventually meet, one-quarter of the
      way around the globe.</p>

    <p>An extreme case of this problem would be illustrated in this scenario:
      instead of marching a mere ten kilometers before they make their turns
      (Figure 17-27), suppose that Alice and Zeno each march 90 degrees around
      the globe (Figure 17-30). This is more easily visualized on an actual
      globe. Pick one up if you have one at hand. Beginning with a Cartesian
      origin in Ecuador, play Zeno&apos;s part and follow the equator 90 degrees
      eastward to somewhere in or near the Congo. Then turn left and go 90
      degrees northward to the pole. That&apos;s where Zeno ends up. Now for Alice&apos;s 
      part. Beginning again at Ecuador, follow the line of 80 degrees west
      longitude, 90 degrees northward to the pole. Then turn right 90 degrees
      and follow the line of 10 degrees west longitude southward to Africa,
      right where Zeno would have taken his left turn.</p>

        different coordinates due to different paths taken to get to them.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So it turns out that there is more than one way to describe any <i>x</i>
      or <i>y</i> coordinate in this coordinate system. Following Zeno&apos;s 
      path, we could give Ecuador the coordinates of <span class="row_vector">[0, 0]</span>; the Congo
      coordinates of <span class="row_vector">[90, 0]</span> (ninety degrees or distance units in the <i>x</i>
      direction from <span class="row_vector">[0, 0]</span>); and the north pole a coordinate of 
	  <span class="row_vector">[90, 90]</span> (90
      distance units in the <i>y</i> direction from <span class="row_vector">[90, 0]</span>).  Following
      Alice&apos;s path, we could give Ecuador the coordinates of <span class="row_vector">[0, 0]</span>; the north
      pole the coordinates of <span class="row_vector">[0, 90]</span> (ninety degrees or distance units in the <i>y</i>
      direction from <span class="row_vector">[0, 0]</span>); 
	  and the Congo a coordinate of <span class="row_vector">[90, 90]</span> (90
      distance units in the <i>x</i> direction from <span class="row_vector">[0, 90]</span>).</p>
    <p>This problem is one of <em>orthogonality</em>; the straight lines drawn
      at intervals across the <i>x</i> axis and the straight lines drawn at
      intervals across the <i>y</i> axis meet at right angles only at the
      origin and nowhere else (Figure 17-31). A coordinate system of this type
      would be more generally called an <dfn>affine </dfn> system rather than a
      Cartesian system which specifically requires orthogonal directions of <i>x</i>
      and <i>y</i> at every point. We have the same problem in any system
      having non-aligned poles; at latitudes where the nearest magnetic pole is
      in a more significantly different direction than the geographic pole (the
      axis of the earth&apos;s spin, which points at the North Star), we need to know
      the angle between true north and magnetic north in order to follow a map
      using a compass.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The essential question is how we choose to establish each coordinate. For
      the <i>x</i> coordinate at a given point, do we choose the value of <i>x</i>
      that lies on the <i>x</i> axis on a straight line from that point,
      running perpendicular to the <i>x</i> axis? Do we follow a curving
      latitude line from that point back to the <i>y</i> axis and measure that
      distance as <i>x</i>? Or do we choose the distance <i>x</i> along a
      straight line that runs from that point perpendicularly through the <i>y</i>
      axis?
   </p>
    <p>Let&apos;s set those questions aside for the moment and look at a coordinate
      system in flat space having non-orthogonal axes (Figure 17-32). Again,
      there are three ways in which we might choose to establish the <i>x</i>
      coordinate for any point. We might run a line from that point
      perpendicular to the <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> axis and call the
      distance from the point to either of those axes <i>x</i>. Or we could
      draw a line through that point parallel to the <i>y</i> axis, and the
      distance <i>x</i> would be where that line meets the <i>x</i> axis.
      Of these three options, only the first, a perpendicular projection onto
      the <i>x</i> axis, and the last, a parallel projection onto the <i>x</i>
      axis, are given serious consideration in textbooks. And that will be fine
      for us. Likewise, to find the <i>y</i> coordinate, we will only
      consider the two options of perpendicular or parallel projection onto the
      <i>y</i> axis.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>In Figure 17-32, we have a coordinate system which uses numbers rather
      than letters to index its coordinates. This is a common practice in
      differential geometry. So what we see in the above figure in place of <i>x</i>
      is the generalized coordinate  <i>e</i><sub>1</sub>;the <dfn>basis
        vector</dfn> <b>e</b><sub>1</sub> points along the horizontal
      axis and has a length of one. Basis vectors by definition point in the
      direction of some coordinate and have unit length. The basis vector <b>e</b><sub>2</sub>
      points along the (sort of) vertical axis, which roughly corresponds to the
      more familiar <i>y</i> axis. Between these two axes is the vector <b>v</b>,
      which has a magnitude and direction which we can describe using two
      components, each of which corresponds to one of the coordinate axes. Now
      if  <b>e</b><sub>1</sub> and  <b>e</b><sub>2</sub>
      were orthogonal, there would be no ambiguity in how to establish the
      components of any vector. Measuring parallel to one axis would mean
      measuring perpendicular to the other, and vice versa. But as we have seen
      now in curved space, this isn&apos;t necessarily the case. We end up with two
      projection methods, parallel and perpendicular, and two sets of basis
      vectors, covariant and contravariant.</p>
    <p>The first coordinate (or component) of <b>v</b> (the one we
      might have called the <i>x</i> component) can be established in two
      ways: we can drop a line perpendicular to the  <b>e</b><sub>1</sub>
      basis vector and use whatever value corresponds to the distance along an
      axis perpendicular to  <b>e</b><sub>2</sub>, an axis
      that we will call <b>e</b><sup>1</sup>(with an <em>upstairs</em> 1).
      In Figure 17-32, that value is <b>v</b><sub>1</sub>. In this
      case, the coordinate index goes <q>downstairs</q> as a subscript and we call <b>v</b><sub>1</sub>
      the first <em>covariant</em> component of <b>v</b> (see
      Chapter Five for the meaning of the terms <dfn>covariant</dfn> and <dfn>contravariant</dfn>,
      but don&apos;t worry about it too much for now). On the other hand, we could
      establish the first component of <b>v</b> by running a line
      parallel to the  <b>e</b><sub>2</sub> basis vector
      and using whatever value corresponds to that distance parallel the <b>e</b><sub>1</sub>
      axis. In Figure 17-32, that value is <b>v</b><sup>1</sup>. In
      this case, the coordinate index goes <q>upstairs</q> as a superscript and we
      call <b>v</b><sup>1</sup> the first <em>contravariant</em> component
      of <b>v</b>.</p>
    <p>Likewise, the second component can be established by either of these two
      methods. A measurement perpendicular to <b>e</b><sub>2</sub>, a
      <q>projection,</q> onto an axis perpendicular to <b>e</b><sub>1</sub>,
      results in the covariant component <b>v</b><sub>2</sub>. A
      parallel projection gives us the contravariant component <b>v</b><sup>2</sup>.
      This is one of those situations when context is important. The
      superscripted two doesn&apos;t indicate the square of <b>v</b>;
      instead it means the second of its contravariant components. Note that the
      contravariant/upstairs-indexed vector components get paired with the
      downstairs-indexed/covariant basis vectors, and vice versa. In Chapter
      Nineteen I will owe you a better explanation of why, but for now just
      understand that it has to do with the way that basis vectors and their
      corresponding components change in opposite ways, as discussed at the end
      of Chapter Eleven.</p>
    <p>Again, yes, you are quite right if you are thinking that this is all very
      complicated. It takes a lot of getting used to.</p>
    <p>There&apos;s a lot of discussion yet to be had on what <dfn>dot products</dfn>
      are, the meaning of the terms covariant and contravariant as they apply
      here, how covariant components are the dot products of the vector in
      question with the basis vectors, and how contravariant components are the
      dot products of that vector with what are called the <dfn>dual basis vectors</dfn> 
	  <b>e</b><sup>1</sup> and <b>e</b><sup>2</sup>.
      It&apos;s all an extension of the idea of projection that we saw in Figure
      8-13, and it ties into the dot operator that you may have taken notice of
      in Chapter Eleven, as well as that chapter&apos;s brief discussion of basis
      vectors and contravariance. We aren&apos;t going to delve much more deeply into
      all that just yet (we&apos;ll save that for Chapter Nineteen), but the more of
      the mathematics of general relativity that you want to understand, the
      more of that you&apos;ll need to know. For that purpose I would recommend
      Daniel Fleisch&apos;s <cite>A Student&apos;s Guide to Vectors and Tensors</cite> as a
      good starting point for those who prefer written material; in Chapter
      Nineteen I will have some video content to recommend to you.</p>
    <p>Suffice it to say for now that the fact our two coordinate axes in 17-32
      do not meet at right angles &mdash; that they are <dfn>non-orthogonal</dfn>, in
      other words &mdash;  creates an obvious duality in how we describe any
      vectors in the system, and these <q>dual spaces</q> of vectors with co- and
      contravariant components become important. This is why I suggested in
      Chapter <i>i</i> that you might consider the dual spaces of the complex
      plane as arising from some fundamental interdependence &mdash; we might think of
      it as a <em>non-orthogonality</em> of some sort &mdash;  between the real
      and imaginary numbers. We will find a similar non-orthogonality or
      interdependence between time and space in this second section of the
      book.  The comparisons I am making here will probably not stand up to
      close scrutiny, because they arise from a hunch having its origins in my
      superficial understanding of statistical analysis, which may not have
      anything to do with the subjects at hand; but I do find some interesting
      correspondences here. </p>
    <p>Setting all that aside for the moment, at last we get to see the role of
      the other two elements in our metric tensor. By the law of cosines (<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>
      = <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> - 2<i>ab</i>*cos&theta;),
      the length <i>v</i> (also denoted as |<b>v</b>|) of the
      vector <b>v</b> having contravariant components <b>v</b><sup>1</sup>
      and <b>v</b><sup>2</sup> (which can easily be misinterpreted as
      powers of a number <b>v</b>, I know, but this is the convention
      we are stuck with) is calculated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>v</i><sup>2</sup> = |<b>v</b>|<sup>2</sup> = (<b>v</b><sup>1</sup>)<sup>2</sup>
        +   (<b>v</b><sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> -
        2( <b>v</b><sup>1</sup> <b>v</b><sup>2</sup>cos &phi;)
        = 1<b>v</b><sup>1</sup><b>v</b><sup>1</sup> - 1<b>v</b><sup>1</sup>
        <b>v</b><sup>2</sup>cos &phi; - 1<b>v</b><sup>2</sup>
        <b>v</b><sup>1</sup>cos &phi; + 1<b>v</b><sup>2</sup><b>v</b><sup>2</sup></p>
      <p><b>Equation 17-2.</b>  <span class="equation_description">The length of a vector in terms of its
        contravariant components and the angle between them and between the
        basis vectors.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>where &phi; is the angle between the two contravariant components of <b>v</b>.
   </p>
    <p>In terms of a metric tensor, this would be as follows in Figure 17-33,
      remembering that the elements of this tensor are indexed as shown in
      Figure 17-34:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/tensor7take2.png" style="max-height: 100px;">

        17-33.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The symmetry in the upper right and lower left terms, which are zero in the
    metric tensor for orthogonal systems (Figure 17-22), gives us the  <q>minus two</q> factor from the law of cosines. Notice that this metric tensor has no
    terms which include the coordinates themselves; for this reason we need only
    look at how the angle &phi; changes from place to place to determine whether the
    space this metric describes is flat. In Figure 17-32, this angle between the
    axes does not change and the space is flat. But in the curved space of
    Figure 17-31 we can see the angle between the two basis vectors changing (as
    shown in the direction of the coordinate lines) as we move away from the
    origin, and the metric itself would then change in value with this angle.
   </p>

    <p>We write the indexes for the tensor elements in Figure 17-33 <q>downstairs</q>
      as subscripts ( G<sub>11 </sub>at upper left, G<sub>12</sub> upper right,
      G<sub>21</sub> lower left, and so on). We pair the downstairs tensor
      elements with the <q>upstairs</q>-indexed vector components shown in the
      key.  So when we are computing the length of a vector, we pair G<sub>11</sub>
      with the quantity <b>v</b><sup>1</sup> times  <b>v</b><sup>1</sup>,
      G<sub>12</sub> with the quantity <b>v</b><sup>1</sup>
      times  <b>v</b><sup>2</sup>, and so on, as hinted at in
      equation 17-3 (see <a href="tail.html">Notes</a> ). Let&apos;s make it more explicit:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><b>|s|</b> <sup>2</sup> = G<sub>11</sub> <b>v</b><sup>1</sup><b>v</b><sup>1</sup>
        + G<sub>12</sub> <b>v</b><sup>1</sup><b>v</b><sup>2</sup>
        + G<sub>21</sub> <b>v</b><sup>2</sup><b>v</b><sup>1</sup>
        + G<sub>22</sub> <b>v</b><sup>2</sup><b>v</b><sup>2</sup>
     </p>
      <p><b>Equation 17-4</b> (see end notes for 17-3).  <span class="equation_description">
        The length of a vector <b>s</b> in terms of its contravariant
        components and the corresponding metric tensor G. Note the downstairs
        indexes for the tensor, which match the index placement for the basis
        vectors it pairs with.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Finally, let&apos;s rewrite equation 17-4 using the shortcut called Einstein
      notation. When we are working in spaces of more than two dimensions, all
      of the terms for each of the elements in the tensor can create a lot of
      clutter. So we could instead express Equation 17-4 using the letters <i>i</i>
      and <i>j</i> to stand for all possible values (1 and 2 in two
      dimensions) of the components&apos; indices, and taking it as implicit that we
      add a term for each possible value or combination of the index or indices
      that appear both <q>upstairs</q> and
       <q>downstairs</q>:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><b>|s|</b><sup>2</sup> = G<i><sub>ij</sub></i> <b>v</b><i><sup>i</sup></i><b>v</b><i><sup>j</sup></i>
     </p>
      <p><b>Equation 17-5.</b>  <span class="equation_description">Equation 17-4 rewritten using the
        Einstein summation notation.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Though its meaning isn&apos;t immediately apparent, this convention of
      summarizing terms is standard in most texts discussing general relativity.
      
   </p>
    <p>We haven&apos;t discussed much about linear algebra or matrix multiplication
      here yet, but we will get there in Chapter Nineteen. For those
      who are already familiar with linear algebra, I offer the following. In
      terms of matrix multiplication, Equations 17-4 and 17-5 would be written
      as:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><b>|s|</b><sup>2</sup> = <b>v</b><sup>T</sup>G<b>v</b></p>
      <p><b>Equation 17-6.</b>  <span class="equation_description">Equation 17-4 rewritten as a pair of
        matrix multiplication operations, where <b>v</b> is a column
        vector with contravariant components, <b>G</b>is the metric
        tensor, and <b>v</b><sup>T</sup> is the row
        vector resulting from the <em>transposition</em> of <b>v</b>
        (which in this case means simply setting <b>v</b> on its
        side).</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>where the same metric tensor G is treated as a multiplication matrix, and
      the vector <b>v</b> (still using the same contravariant
      components, if we have more than one basis to choose from) is multiplied
      by it twice: first as the (transposed) row vector <b>v</b><sup>T</sup>,
      and then as the column vector <b>v</b>. We&apos;ll see more
      explanation of the meaning of row and column vectors and transposition in
      Chapter Nineteen. If any one of these last three equations goes over your
      head, don&apos;t worry; you might see this as a learning opportunity, because
      really all three of them are just different ways of writing the same
      thing. That being said, you will seldom see something like Equation 17-6
      in a physics text. The Einstein summation convention is far more
      prevalent.</p>
    <p>Lastly, it must be re-emphasized that in spaces where the metric tensor
      is not constant, we write of differential distances <i>ds</i> rather
      than <i>s</i>, and of <i>ds</i><sup>2</sup> rather than <i>s</i><sup>2</sup>;
      likewise we would write of differential components dx<i><sup>i</sup></i>
      or dv<i><sup>i</sup></i> rather than <b>v</b><i><sup>i</sup></i>.
      And we would compute the sum all of these differential changes together
      along with the metric tensor at each point along the way to calculate the
      total distance.  It is a common practice to use a lower-case <i>g</i>
      for the metric tensor and the Greek letters mu and nu for its indices:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>ds</i><sup>2</sup> = g<i><sub>&mu;&nu;</sub></i> dx<i><sup>&mu;</sup></i>dx<i><sup>&nu;</sup></i>
     </p>
      <p><b>Equation 17-7.</b>  <span class="equation_description">Equation 17-5 rewritten in terms of
        differential geometry.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>I realize that we&apos;re still a long way from being able to calculate the
      shortest path from Seattle to Berlin, but my intention in the last half of
      this chapter has been to give some helpful illustrations and examples that
      I find are often missing in mathematical texts and to show the
      relationships between many of the concepts and notations that a serious
      student is likely to encounter. I hope the chapter has been fun and
      interesting even in places where the math may go over the reader&apos;s head
      for now.</p>

    <h3 id="ChapterEighteen">Chapter Eighteen<br>
      The Arrow of Time (II)</h3>
    <p>Section Two of this book can be thought of as proceeding along two
      tracks, one having to do with relativity and the other with quantum
      theory. Whereas differential geometry (in the previous chapter) was an
      important step towards relativity, one of the classical subjects that
      quantum mechanics developed from is <dfn>thermodynamics</dfn>, which we
      will discuss in this chapter.  We will enumerate the three laws of
      thermodynamics one by one and discuss their implications. And we will see
      how thermodynamics is an integral part of a network of physics subjects
      including both quantum theory and relativity.</p>
    <p>The phrase <q>the arrow of time</q> is closely associated with the study of
      thermodynamics and refers to the tendency of many observable phenomena to
      be irreversible. The implication is that time prefers a certain direction
      for some processes. It isn&apos;t at all difficult to melt an ice cube in a hot
      drink; one gets warmer while the other gets cooler. It is less simple to
      un-thaw the ice cube out of that same drink.</p>
    <p>Our discussions of physics have so far tended to focus on the physical
      properties of particular objects and how each of them behaves in relation
      to another: a pair of billiard balls, or a satellite orbiting the earth,
      for examples. In these previous examples, each object was accounted for
      individually. Thermodynamics tends to be more about how large numbers of
      objects behave <em>as a group</em>; and as a group, these objects will
      have properties which cannot be ascribed to them individually. For
      example, it is not meaningful to speak of the temperature of an individual
      molecule, its pressure, or really even whether it is in a liquid or
      gaseous state. These properties only have meaning for large numbers of
      molecules.</p>
    <p>Thermodynamics also leads into discussions of <q>isolated systems,</q> volumes
      surrounded by a boundary through which neither matter nor energy can pass.
      These systems contain sets of objects which we can assume are unaffected
      by anything which is not a part of the set, except under conditions which
      we can observe or control. This really isn&apos;t much of an intellectual leap
      from the idea of individual, isolated objects, and I don&apos;t have any
      criticisms to level at either of these ideas at this point, but I wish for
      you to keep in mind the question of whether such isolation actually exists
      in nature; and to note where the term <q>boundary</q> is used, because it will
      play a significant role in quantum mechanics.</p>
    <h4>First Law</h4>
    <p>The First Law of Thermodynamics concerns the conservation of energy. It
      implies that the internal energy of an <em>isolated</em> physical system
      does not change, because no mass or energy is allowed to escape or enter
      it. It states that the internal energy of a <em>closed</em> system, one
      which can exchange heat energy with the outside world but <em>not</em> mass,
      and which can perform physical work on the outside world, changes in
      specific ways. <b>The change in internal energy &Delta;<i>U</i> of a
        closed system is equal to the heat energy <i>Q</i> passing through
        the boundary of the system minus the work <i>W</i> the system does on
        the outside world</b> (a loose definition of <q>work</q> in this context
      is force times distance, which has the same units of measurement as
      energy):</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p>&Delta;<i>U</i> = <i>Q</i> - <i>W</i></p>
      <p><b>Equation 18-1</b>.  <span class="equation_description">The First Law of Thermodynamics.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Consider the compression of a spring as an example of work; you apply a
      force against the spring and succeed in decreasing its length by some
      distance. The work done on the spring is that force times that distance,
      and results in an equivalent amount of energy being <q>stored</q> in the
      spring; the spring is now able to exert a force on some other object and
      thus turn that stored energy into kinetic energy. Raising a weight to some
      height is likewise an example of work, a vertical force over some vertical
      distance which results in the weight having greater <q>potential energy</q> due
      to gravity. In letting the weight fall again, we let that potential energy
      become kinetic energy.</p>
    <p>So far we haven&apos;t discussed the role of heat energy in all this, but
      we&apos;re getting there. Another example of work is pushing a sled along an
      icy road. We apply a force over some distance, and when we are done, the
      sled has the kinetic energy corresponding to the work we have done, minus
      whatever energy it loses in friction with the icy road. Note that the work
      we did on the sled depends only on the force we applied times the distance
      we applied it over; whether the sled immediately comes to a stop due to
      friction or anything else is not part of the calculation. But where does
      the energy go when it is <q>lost</q> due to friction? It becomes heat
      energy.  As a <q>closed system,</q> we lose energy by doing work on the
      sled (and, coincidentally, by radiating heat as we do so, assuming it is a
      cold day). As a separate closed system, the sled gains the energy
      corresponding to our work, and may gradually lose it in heat exchange with
      the road due to friction.</p>
    <p>If you think that work and heat exchange and energy seem to have a
      mathematically puzzling relationship, I don&apos;t at all disagree with you; I
      think that the distinctions between these three things are somewhat
      contrived. I hope I have already made clear that work is the transfer of
      energy, whether it be kinetic or potential, regardless of what happens to
      that energy after it is transferred. What I would like to do next is
      propose that heat energy can be regarded as a kind of kinetic energy, and
      that its transfer might be regarded as a kind of work, with the result
      that all three things are more obviously equivalent.</p>
    <p>The temperature of a liquid, solid or gas depends on the kinetic energy
      of its individual molecules. This kinetic energy in a gas is the speed at
      which the molecules move freely, bouncing against each other and against
      anything else they encounter; in a solid, where the molecules cannot move
      freely, it is the speed at which they vibrate in relation to one another
      around some equilibrium position, like masses connected by a lattice of
      springs. When friction occurs, there are collisions between small bumps on
      the two surfaces in question. These collisions exert forces over very
      small distances. Work is being done, even if only on a microscopic level.
      Even without friction, when we place a warm cup onto a cold saucer, the
      molecules of both surfaces are constantly vibrating and colliding with
      each other. These collisions also exert forces over very small distances,
      and thus <q>work</q> is done even though neither object moves visibly. But I
      don&apos;t think you are likely to see heat transfer described as a form of
      work in many introductory physics textbooks; traditionally the two ideas
      are kept distinct. </p>
    <p>I&apos;d like for us to go all the way back to Chapter Six now, and Figure
      6-2, in which Zeno drops a dry-ish lump of mashed potatoes onto the bed of
      the moving truck. Why does this lump come to a stop rather than bouncing?
      Where does the kinetic energy go once the lump strikes the truck bed? The
      answer is that it becomes heat, or vibrational energy, in the potatoes,
      the truck, and the surrounding air. Some of the energy of the lump&apos;s fall
      goes toward the lump&apos;s deformation as it collides with the truck bed;
      through internal friction, this becomes heat. Some of the energy
      dissipates into the air as sound, making the air vibrate and creating a
      pressurized wave in it; this is a form of heat energy as well, which
      dissipates very rapidly. The rest of the energy becomes heat in the truck
      bed, as the potato lump smacks the surface and causes increased vibration
      in it.</p>
    <h4>Third Law</h4>
    <p>We&apos;re going to do this out of numerical sequence and talk about the third
      law before the second, which seems to require the most explanation, and
      I&apos;d rather not leave the third hanging for that long. This is also a good
      place to explain that the subject of thermodynamics is far from simple, no
      matter how much I may try to simplify it here. Furthermore, I have to
      admit that there are important aspects of it all which I don&apos;t yet
      understand, but what I do understand I will share here. And the reason I
      presume to talk at all about such an immense subject is because it is so
      inseparably connected to other subjects of this book, which I do
      understand somewhat better.</p>
    <p>So, for reasons having much to do with what I have just written, rather
      than present you with the Third Law of Thermodynamics itself, I will
      instead talk about one of its very interesting consequences.</p>
    <p>There is a lower limit to the temperature of any object. If all the
      motion and vibration in all of the molecules were to come to a stop, then
      it would be impossible for them to move any more slowly, and they as a
      group could not be any colder. This lower limit of temperature is the same
      for all the various types of matter, and it is called <q>absolute zero.</q> Its
      value on the centigrade scale is 273.15 degrees below zero (459.67 degrees
      below zero on the Fahrenheit scale).</p>
    <p>The Third Law of Thermodynamics establishes, among other things, that <strong>the
        temperature of any mass cannot be reduced to absolute zero</strong>. We
      can make it get close, but we won&apos;t be able to get it all the way there in
      a finite number of steps. This is one of a few important discoveries of
      the 20th century in which we found that nature had a certain limit which
      we could approach but not reach. One of the other limits was established
      by Einstein&apos;s theory of relativity: you cannot accelerate a mass to the
      speed of light. You can try to get close, but the closer you get, the more
      energy will be required to get any closer. The other highly significant
      limit is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics; we discovered an inherent
      level of uncertainty in the position and momentum of a particle. We can&apos;t
      know the values of both of those quantities beyond certain limits of
      precision.</p>
    <h4>Second Law</h4>
    <p>Again, I feel obligated to emphasize my lack of qualifications regarding
      the basic subject matter of thermodynamics. Regarding the Second Law in
      particular, rather than make expert judgements on the state of the
      science, I only feel qualified to comment on the quality of instruction
      one might find in various places. It is the Second Law of Thermodynamics
      which gives meaning to the phrase <q>The Arrow of Time;</q> and of the three
      laws, it is the Second which is the subject of so much rhetoric and
      hand-wringing in so many popular science books. So have your critical
      thinking skills at the ready, friends, we&apos;re going to talk about entropy.
   </p>
    <p>I am grateful to Sean Carroll, author of <cite>From Eternity to Here</cite>
      (among others), for introducing me to what I regard as an excellent
      starting point for the Second Law, as well for as motivating me to pick up
      and read a play that I now cherish deeply. In Tom Stoppard&apos;s <cite>Arcadia</cite>,
      a young woman named Thomasina poses a fascinating question to her tutor:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When you stir your rice pudding, Septimus, the spoonful of jam spreads
        itself round making red trails like the picture of a meteor in my
        astronomical atlas. But if you stir backwards, the jam will not come
        together again. Indeed, the pudding does not notice and continues to
        turn pink just as before. Do you think this is odd?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Thomasina has noted that some physical processes seem irreversible. We
      might ask a similar question regarding Zeno&apos;s fallen lump of mashed
      potatoes. What, if anything, can we do to make the lump resume its
      previous shape and rise back to the point it was dropped from? Is it
      possible for us to send the sonic energy back to it though the air and to
      simultaneously strike the truck in places all around it in such a manner
      that the energy will return to the lump in a great converging wave and
      send it flying upward?</p>
    <p>Certain things just wouldn&apos;t seem plausible if we were to watch a film of
      them in reverse. We would know the visual trick that was being played on
      us. If we had video of the lump of mashed potatoes hitting the truck bed
      and ran it in reverse, the fakery would be obvious. Even if we turned the
      image upside down to imitate the potatoes becoming unstuck from the
      underside of the truck and then <q>falling,</q> something about the way the
      lump changed shape as it began to <q>drop</q> would look suspicious. The idea
      of running a film backwards is used often in popular science literature in
      the context of the Second Law, for good reasons; it makes the reader stop
      to think and gives them something easy to visualize. But it can also
      distract readers from the real point, and give the impression that highly
      improbable outcomes are supposed to be impossible. I will give an example
      later of an engineering feat which is in some ways equivalent to
      un-shattering a mirror or making Zeno&apos;s potatoes fly upward off of the
      truck bed.</p>
    <p>There is nothing in the laws of mechanics governing the behavior of the
      truck or the mashed potatoes that rules out the entire process running in
      reverse. And yet it doesn&apos;t happen. This is where some writers will try to
      fill in what they see as a gap in physics, and they will try to use the
      Second Law of Thermodynamics to do it. The simple truth is that energy (in
      low densities at least) tends to dissipate, to flow <em>outward</em>. But
      mechanical physics isn&apos;t usually written in terms of <q>inward</q> or
      <q>outward.</q> It is mostly written in terms of vectors, which go
       <q>this way</q>
      or <q>that way.</q> We have an equation that describes the diffusion of heat
      quite nicely, written in terms of vectors. But the Second Law which gives
      us the <q>arrow of time</q> isn&apos;t about diffusion, <i>per se</i>; it
      concerns something subtler, which scientists call <dfn>entropy.</dfn> Different
      writers have different descriptions for entropy, and some of them are not
      very useful; the ones that try to fill in this perceived <q>gap</q> in science
      are usually the less sensible.</p>
    <p>The most concise and useful definition of the entropy of a system has to
      do with its ability (or perhaps its <em>in</em>ability) to do work. A
      weight hanging from a pulley can do work because of its gravitational
      potential energy. A container of pressurized gas has kinetic energy that
      can be made to do work in an environment of lower pressure. A hot object
      can be made to do work if there is a cooler object to distribute the heat
      to. We say that a disequilibrium in temperature or pressure across some
      boundary creates a condition of relatively low entropy and that this low
      entropy is associated with the system&apos;s ability to do work.</p>
    <p>The Second Law of Thermodynamics can and has been stated in many ways,
      but we will consider it in this manner: <strong>the entropy of any
      isolated system never decreases over time</strong>, and increases as any
      work is done; thus <strong>the ability of any system to do work is finite</strong>.
      Once a system reaches equilibrium in temperature and pressure, when all
      the chemical energy has been extracted by burning all of the fossil fuels
      and so on &hellip; when maximum entropy is reached, the game is over and no
      more work can be done. The German word for entropy is <i>W&auml;rmetod</i>,
      which also translates as <q>heat death.</q> This physical law is unusual in
      that it has a specified direction in time.</p>
    <p>You will find a lot of talk about order and disorder in books that
      discuss entropy and the Second Law. Examine such matters with a critical
      eye. You may, for example, be given to imagine a closed container of air
      in which there is some imaginary, completely permeable boundary between
      one end of the container and the other, and that at some moment, there is
      greater average pressure on one side of the boundary than the other. In
      other words, there is more pressure on one end of the container than the
      other. You may then have it suggested to you that this closed system is in
      a state of low entropy and perhaps even in a more highly <em>ordered</em> state
      than one having uniform pressure. But is it? Someone may assert to you
      that the gas in the container will over time reach an equilibrium state of
      uniform pressure (and that this all has something to do with
      irreversibility and the <q>arrow of time,</q> etc. etc.). But will it? A writer
      who is closer to the mark may say that the pressure difference between the
      to ends of the container could be used to do <em>work</em>, so long as
      that difference persists. But can it?</p>
    <p>In this case, if we take entropy to mean anything more or less than the
      inability to do work, we will stumble. Because whether the equilibrium
      state of the container is to have uniform or nonuniform pressure, and
      whether a state of uniform pressure is or is not able to produce work
      could depend on gravity. If there is a strong difference in gravity
      between one end of the container and the other, the pressure will differ
      from end to end once equilibrium is reached, for the same reason that air
      pressure is greater at sea level than at high altitudes. And these
      differences in pressure cannot be exploited to do work. In strong gravity,
      a system at uniform pressure will evolve over time toward non-uniform
      pressure. In zero gravity, the reverse is true. The movie runs backwards
      in one situation compared to the other. It is tempting to suppose that
      gravity tends to slow or reverse the flow of time in some sense. We&apos;ll
      return to this idea in Chapter Twenty-Five when we discuss general
      relativity.</p>
    <p>Randomness and order are highly subjective. The character string
      <q>5f4dcc3b5aa<wbr>765d61d8327de<wbr>b882cf99</q> has no immediately apparent order, but
      it is in fact the MD5 hash of the string <q>password</q>. We might look at a
      set of five playing cards one by one, finding no particular order in the
      face value of the cards, and judge the set to have no  meaningful
      order. Someone else might look at the same set of cards and see not the
      first, but the second five digits of pi. The order or randomness of
      something depends a great deal on how it is being measured or what it is
      being compared to.</p>
    <p>Let&apos;s return again to the closed container of air, and imagine some
      invisible, fully permeable boundary that divides the container into equal
      halves, left and right. If we found that by some miracle all of the air
      molecules in the container were on the left side, we would indeed be
      surprised, and with good reason. Why? Because that is a highly improbable
      state. How improbable is it? The standard scientific way of answering that
      is to first ask  how many air molecules are in the container. That&apos;s 
      something that we can measure with some degree of accuracy, but let&apos;s 
      suppose that we happen to know that there are exactly 10,000 molecules in
      the container. Next, we ask: out of all the possible ways that these
      molecules could be arranged, how many of them correspond to having all of
      them being on the right, and how many of them correspond to some other
      distribution? Then, we implicitly assign each molecule a binary property
      of left or right, and say that there is only one outcome that corresponds
      to all of them being on the left, while there are an astronomical number
      of other possibilities. But think about what we have done: we have greatly
      simplified our description of the system. We drew an arbitrary boundary
      across the middle and reduced the set of states that an individual
      molecule could be in to one of two possibilities. We don&apos;t consider any
      difference between the molecules being all huddled in the upper-left
      hundredth of the container&apos;s left half on one hand, or on the other hand
      being evenly distributed through the left half; we chose the boundary
      where we chose it, and that is the limit of the detail we are considering.
      Neither do we distinguish one molecule from another; we don&apos;t care whether
      the oxygen molecules are to the left of the nitrogen molecules, or vice
      versa, or all mixed together. We don&apos;t care how fast any of them are going
      individually. As long as they&apos;re all on the left-hand side, it&apos;s all the
      same probability.
   </p>
    <p>When it comes to regarding entropy as a measure of order or probability,
      it&apos;s important to realize that there is an inherent subjectivity in it. To
      give a numeric value to the probability of all the molecules being on the
      left-hand side of the container, we are choosing to disregard any other
      information about the system; as Carlo Rovelli put it, we are <em>blurring</em> 
      our view of it all in some way:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The entropy of a system depends explicitly on blurring. It depends on
        what I <em>do not</em> register, because it depends on the number of 
        <em>indistinguishable</em> configurations. The <em>same</em> microscopic configuration may
        be of high entropy with regard to one blurring and of low in relation to
        another.<!-- (p. 145)--></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What is <em>not</em> subjective is the container&apos;s ability to do work.
      If we replace our imaginary boundary with an impermeable physical barrier
      that we can move, we have something like a piston. If we move the barrier
      from one end of the container toward the other, the number of possible
      positions each of the air molecules on one side is reduced; and not
      coincidentally, the pressure inside the container will rise, and we will
      be able to get out of the container the work that we have put into it.</p>
    <p>One final musing about reversibility and the Second Law: in the intense
      gravity at the core of a star, lighter elements are fused into heavier
      ones. In the case of the Sun, hydrogen atoms are fused into helium in a
      great nuclear fire. With each fusion reaction, energy is released which
      keeps the Sun shining and creates an outward pressure from the core. When
      the hydrogen fuel has been all used up, the Sun will begin a new phase of
      its life, with its core becoming super-dense. In stars significantly
      larger than the sun, the gravitational collapse caused by the end of the
      fusion process is followed by a spectacular explosion of heavier elements.
   </p>
    <p>You wouldn&apos;t think that a process like this one could be reversed, but
      consider the atomic bomb. A heavy element, uranium, is formed into
      precisely-shaped pieces which would form a sphere if assembled; and indeed
      when the bomb is detonated, these pieces <em>are</em> assembled into a
      sphere by forcing them together in a number of precisely-timed explosions.
      Precision is key in all aspects of the process, because what happens next
      is otherwise highly improbable. As Robert Anton Wilson puts it in <cite>The
        Universe Next Door</cite>,  <q>The trick is to put the pieces together fast enough to get a decent blast before the bomb blows itself apart.</q> In the
      instant that the uranium forms a compact sphere, it has the mass and
      density required to begin a self-sustaining fission reaction in which
      uranium breaks down into lighter elements, and a great nuclear fire is the
      result. It seems rather like the collapse of a star, in reverse.</p>
    <p>A less commonly discussed but certainly intriguing perspective on entropy
      was that of Henri Poincar&eacute;, who said that entropy must increase as well as
      decrease,<!--III:131/Lindley 24-25--> due to all possible states of a
      system being inevitable given enough time. Or, as Hamlet put it,
      <!--Citation?--> <q>If it be not now, yet it will come.</q> If that be the
      case, I can say with confidence that Poincar&eacute; will eventually not only
      read this book, but favor it with a positive review (Okay, I am stretching
      the facts. Poincar&eacute;&apos;s statement was in the specific context of all
      possible arrangements of molecules in a volume of gas).</p>

      Math Vocabulary (II) </h3>
    <p>As with the previous <q>Math Vocabulary</q> chapter, I am going to preface my
      remarks by giving you my explicit permission to skim through this chapter
      or skip over it entirely. The intent of this chapter is to help you move
      forward rather than to be an obstacle in your way. There is more than one
      path through the key concepts of physics, and sometimes we aren&apos;t ready
      learn the answers to questions we haven&apos;t asked yet. If you do choose to
      pass over this chapter&apos;s material for now, you may find the motivation in
      a later chapter to ask questions that are answered here.</p>
    <p>In Chapter Eight, I mentioned that vector operations are important in 3D
      gaming; what I didn&apos;t say is that these operations are related to
      something called matrix multiplication. At the end of Chapter Seventeen, I
      mentioned matrix multiplication as an alternative way to represent some of
      the math there. In Chapter <i>i</i>, I mentioned that complex numbers
      are well-suited for representing and working with rotations; but I didn&apos;t
      mention that matrix multiplication was another way of doing the same. I
      wasn&apos;t going to write much about matrix multiplication, let alone a whole
      chapter, but then I saw this topic covered so beautifully in a series of
      YouTube videos that I just had to tell you about it. So hats off to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@eigenchris"
        target="_blank">eigenchris</a> for some truly excellent work on many
      topics; I will be taking inspiration from his videos for the material in
      many of the chapters to follow. This chapter in particular will rely
      heavily on the ideas covered in his video <q><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkJ6J1izNBM&amp;list=PLJHszsWbB6hqlw73QjgZcFh4DrkQLSCQa&amp;index=4"
        target="_blank">Relativity 102b: Keys to Relativity - Covariance and
        Contravariance</a>.</q>  Seriously, do yourself a favor and watch this video
      at your earliest convenience, and so many things will start making better
      sense for you. I hope that you will spend some time browsing through his
      channel and finding more interesting things to watch; whatever your level

    <p>One of the main goals of this chapter is to demonstrate how different
      coordinate systems can be reconciled using something called a <dfn>matrix</dfn>,
      which is a structured set of numbers. We&apos;ll revisit classical relativity,
      namely the Galilean transformations, in terms of a transformation matrix;
      and we&apos;ll prepare to do something similar for modern relativity.

    <p>We have already discussed basis vectors and given them a definition; I
      wrote that basis vectors point in the direction of one axis in the
      coordinate system and have unit length. What makes basis vectors important
      is that they represent the coordinate system itself. When we talk about
      the components of a vector, we implicitly mean the vectors components <em>in
        some particular basis</em>. A vector represents some objective quantity
      and direction and in this respect is <em>invariant</em>, even though the
      reality that it describes may change over time and space. What also may
      change is the frame of reference, or <em>basis</em>, which describes it;
      and as this frame of reference or basis changes, the same invariant vector
      is described by a different set components. This was illustrated in Figure
      8-14 by a measuring tool that moved to measure a fixed object from various
      angles.</p>

    <p>Many of the concepts and terms you will read in this chapter are
      associated with a branch of mathematics called <dfn>linear algebra</dfn>, and I
      heartily encourage you to spend some time getting familiar with it, using
      a variety of resources which will present it in different ways so that
      your particular learning style might be best served. There&apos;s not anything
      in it that is particularly hard; it&apos;s really just another very useful way
      of thinking about math. It&apos;s a way of extending your math <em>vocabulary</em>
      that you will find tremendously advantageous, if not indispensable, in
      understanding many subjects in physics. I learned the basics by watching
      the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8" target="_blank">recordings
        </a>of Gilbert Strang teaching his students at MIT in Spring 2005. You
      needn&apos;t do as I did, nor need you watch the whole lecture series to get
      something of value, but I do recommend giving them a try. The Khan
      Academy&apos;s <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra" target="_blank">videos
        </a>on linear algebra are great as well. I&apos;ll try to cover the
      highlights of the subject, telling you the parts I found most important:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>bases</li>
      <li>linear combinations</li>
      <li>linear independence </li>
      <li>row and column vectors</li>
      <li>dot products and orthogonality </li>
      <li>matrix multiplication</li>
      <li>inverse matrices</li>
      <li>eigenvalues and eigenvectors </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Linear algebra has many applications; I think my first exposure to it was
      in a 100-level political science course in which we used a matrix to find
      correlations of some sort among poll numbers. That was a long time ago.
      What I will present here will be an overview of linear algebra&apos;s 
      relationship with geometry, and that from the rambling perspective of an
      interested amateur rather than an experienced lecturer, so be aware that
      the subject won&apos;t be getting anything like a full treatment. And in case
      you are wondering, everything that follows in this chapter is in the
      context of flat, Euclidean spaces, not like any of the curved geometries
      of Chapter Seventeen.</p>
    <p>There is a notation form for vectors that I have avoided so far, because
      it is vertical rather than horizontal, and for this reason it doesn&apos;t fit
      in a single line of text. So far, I have written the components of a
      vector from left to right, like this: (0,8,-9). But since we&apos;ll be talking
      about linear algebra, we&apos;re often going to be seeing the components
      written top-to-bottom, like this:</p>
    <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/vector1.png" style="max-height: 100px;"></p>
    <p>In this form, we call the vector a <dfn>column vector</dfn>, and later
      we&apos;ll talk about what distinguishes it from a <dfn>row vector</dfn>.</p>
    <p>One of the first games you learn to play in linear algebra goes something
      like this: given a set of linear equations &mdash; wow, have we even talked
      about those yet? Linear equations? No? Whoops! Okay, backing up just a
      little bit.</p>
    <h4>Linear equations</h4>
    <p>Before you can play any of the <q>systems of linear equations</q> games, you
      need to know the rules of the <q>specify a line using two numbers</q> game. And
      that one goes like this: in two dimensions, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>,
      there are an infinite number of ways to draw a line. And by <dfn>line</dfn> in
      this context, we mean something that continues endlessly without changing
      direction. One way to determine a line is to specify any two points on it.
      There is only one line that can pass through both of those points. But
      each of those points will have an <i>x</i> and a <i>y</i>
      coordinate, so that way of specifying a line requires four numbers (two
      pairs). It turns out that the absolute minimum set of numbers you need in
      order to specify a line is two. And this special pair of numbers, like
      many things in mathematics, can be thought of in more than one way. The
      graphical way of thinking about these numbers is that one of them tells
      you at which value of <i>y</i> your line crosses the <i>y</i> axis;
      and the other number tells you the slope of your line, how steep it is.
      Let&apos;s look at an example:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/slope-intercept.png" style="max-height: 450px;"></p>
      <p><b>Figure 19-1.</b>  The graph of the function <i>y</i>=½<i>x</i>
        + 3. Source: desmos.com (<a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/59qdbtnlzy"
          target="_blank">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/59qdbtnlzy</a>)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The line in Figure 19-1 has a slope of one-half (its <i>y</i> value
      increases one unit, vertically, for every two <i>x</i> units,
      horizontally), and meets the <i>y</i> axis at a <i>y</i>-value of
      three. So its important numbers are one-half and three.</p>
    <p>The non-graphical way to think about the two numbers that make a line is
      to say that <i>y</i> is a function of <i>x</i>, and that in that
      function, the first of the two numbers is multiplied by <i>x</i>, and
      the second number is added to the product of <i>x</i> and the first
      number. In the example above, <i>y</i> as a function of <i>x</i>
      equals ½<i>x</i> + 3. Generally, the equation of a line takes the form <i>y=mx
        + b</i>, where <i>m</i> is the slope of the line and <i>b</i> is
      its <q><i>y</i>-intercept,</q> the value of <i>y</i> where the line
      crosses the <i>y</i> axis. But there is a notable set of exceptions,
      those being the lines parallel to the <i>y</i> axis, which (by
      definition of parallelism) do not cross it at any value of <i>y</i>;
      these have infinite slope and their equation takes the form <i>x</i>=<i>c</i>
      with <i>c</i> being some constant and <i>y</i> having all possible
      values.</p>
    <p>Desmos.com hosts a free version of the  <q>specify any line using two numbers</q> game at the link shown in Figure 19-1. Using the sliders on the
      left-hand side of the page, you can change the value of <i>m</i> to
      change your line&apos;s slope, and the value of <i>b</i> to raise or lower
      your line.</p>
    <h4>Systems of linear equations</h4>
    <p>With that out of the way, we&apos;re ready for a more sophisticated game which
      we&apos;ll call the span game. Given a space in which every point is specified
      by two real numbers, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>; and given a set of
      lines, linear equations of the form <i>y=mx + b</i>, the challenge is
      to determine whether the set of lines will span the entire two-dimensional
      <q>space.</q>  In linear algebra,
       this <q>space</q> is called <b>R</b><sup>2</sup>
       (<q>R-two</q>), the set of all pairs of real numbers, or the space of all
      vectors having two components <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. By asking
      whether the lines in your set <em>span</em> the entire space, the
      question really is this: given any and every possible line in this space,
      will there be a line in your given set that will cross it?</p>
    <p>In general terms, if you only have one line, then you don&apos;t have the full
      span of the space; your line has only one dimension, and the space has
      two. If all of the lines in your set are parallel, then your span is not
      complete in that case either; it only covers those lines and not the
      spaces (or lines) between them. But if you have just two lines that are
      not exactly parallel, even if they are close, then you have a full span of
      the space. For any other possible line in the space, it is guaranteed that
      one of the two non-parallel lines in your set will cross it somewhere,
      eventually. That is one of the fundamentals of Euclidean geometry, really;
      a line can&apos;t be parallel to two other lines unless those lines are
      parallel to each other.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/non-parallel.png" style="max-height: 450px;">
 		</p>
      <p><b>Figure 19-2</b>. Two non-parallel lines. There is no line
        that can be drawn in this space that will not eventually cross one of
        these two lines.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another way of looking at the problem, one which takes us from the idea
      of a span to the more familiar idea of a <q>basis,</q> is to take a small piece
      of each line in your given set and to call it a vector; and then to test
      whether you can make all possible vectors in <b>R</b><sup>2 </sup>via
      some <em>linear combination</em> of these vectors. If it takes three
      copies of one piece and half a copy of another to make a given vector,
      that&apos;s good enough. After all, you&apos;re free to chop up the lines in your
      set to any size you want. In Figure19-3, we see that three copies of a
      piece cut from the blue line can be added to four copies of a piece from
      the red line to make the vector shown in green; we could do the same to
      compose any vector we can imagine. If we have two non-parallel lines, we
      have the span of the space, and the more important consequence is that we
      can construct a complete pair of <em>basis vectors</em> for this space,
      and for this particular coordinate system of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
      values we have been using; in fact, by making linear combinations of the
      vectors from your set, you can make a pair of basis vectors for <em>all</em> possible
      bases, all possible coordinate systems in <b>R</b><sup>2</sup>.
   </p>

      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/linear-combination.png"

        non-parallel lines (red and blue) in a two-dimensional space can be

    </blockquote>
    <p>This game is pretty trivial in two dimensions, because the way to test
      whether two lines are parallel is just to compare their slopes, the <i>m</i>
      in their equations of the form <i>y=mx + b</i>. It gets more
      interesting in three dimensions, the vector space we call <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>,
      in which we have three coordinate variables <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and
      <i>z</i>. In this version of the game, to determine whether your set of
      lines spans the entire space, the question is whether this set will
      intersect every possible plane in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>.</p>
    <p>First of all, how are planes and lines even defined in three dimensions?
      If we take the equation of any line in <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> and
      apply it to <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> there are now an infinite
      number of lines that satisfy that equation. The line <i>y</i>=½<i>x</i>
      + 3 in Figure 19-1 would have one solution in the plane <i>z</i>=0 and
      another solution for every possible value of <i>z</i>; to visualize
      this, imagine a stack of an infinite number of copies of Figure 19-1
      parallel to the one on your screen or printed page. So we are going to
      need at least one more number, a <i>z</i> value, to specify one and
      only one line in three dimensions. But that third number only gets us as
      far as being able to specify lines that lie in a plane of constant <i>z</i>
      value. It turns out that we need <em>six</em> numbers in order to have
      room for specifying any possible line in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>,
      which seems odd in light of the fact that we only needed two for <b>R</b><sup>2</sup>.
      Do you think that this might be another case where that strange factorial
      function from Chapter Fifteen appears? 2!=2, 3!=6 &hellip; that might be
      worth looking into, but we&apos;ll leave that alone for now.  We can
      budget our six numbers in two ways: we use one set of three for specifying
      any point on our line using its <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>
      coordinates; and with the remaining three numbers, we can either specify a
      second point on the line or we can specify the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
      and <i>z</i> components of a <em>direction</em> away from point number
      one, which is kind of the same thing, because this direction vector will
      give you the direction and distance to another point on the line.</p>

    <p>In Figure 19-4, we see an example in which one point on a line is
      specified by the coordinates (2,1,-1). The rest of the line can be defined
      either by the second point (-2,-1,3) or by the vector (-4,-2,4). This last
      vector can be multiplied by any scalar value &lambda; and then added to the
      position vector (2,1,-1), and the result will lie on the line. If &lambda;=1,
      then the result is the point (-2,-1,3) shown in the figure.</p>
    <p>As for planes, we might say that the equation for a plane takes the
      general form <i>z</i>=<i>px</i> + <i>qy</i> + <i>c</i>, with <i>p</i>
      being a z-slope in the <i>x</i> direction (<i>&part;z</i>/<i>&part;x</i>
      in calculus terms), <i>q</i> being a z-slope in the <i>y</i>
      direction (<i>&part;z</i>/<i>&part;y</i>), and <i>c</i>
      being the <i>z</i> value where the plane intersects the <i>z</i>
      axis. Similar to our exceptions in <b>R</b><sup>2</sup>, we
      will need to separately handle cases where <i>p</i> or <i>q</i> is
      infinite and where <i>z</i> can have any value by using the form <i>y</i>=<i>mx</i>
      + <i>b</i>. In Figure 19-5, for example, the green plane might have the
      equation <i>y</i> = (0<i>x</i> +) 2. The red plane might be something
      like &hellip; <i>z</i> = 2<i>x</i> - 0.5<i>y</i> - 1? I didn&apos;t choose
      this illustration with numbers in mind, nor did I take extreme care when
      drawing number scales on it, but I think that&apos;s a pretty good guess.</p>

    <p>So, back to the <q>span game:</q> given some set of lines in three dimensions,
      can you tell whether or not every possible plane in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>
      would be intersected by at least one of those lines? In other words, can
      your set of lines be chopped up and recombined to form a complete basis
      for <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>? If you were given a pair of lines in
      the <i>x</i>-<i>y</i> plane (having the same fixed value of <i>z</i>)
      that each had a different slope, then you would have a span for that
      plane; if you had a third line that had a variable <i>z</i> value, then
      your span would be complete. But that is a special case, and unlike a
      picture, a system of equations doesn&apos;t always make obvious how one line
      relates to another. The real challenge is when you <em>don&apos;t</em> have a
      pair of lines that obviously lie in the same plane, and a third that
      obviously intersects that plane. This would be a case where intuition and
      graphing are less effective than the numerical methods that are in the
      linear algebra tool set.</p>
    <p>Those numerical methods, which we&apos;ll soon get to, are the same for the
      span game as for a related game which I call the <q>intersection game:</q>
      given a set of equations for lines or planes, can you find one and only
      one point where they all intersect? It turns out that these two games are
      closely related, because if your equations don&apos;t fully span the space,
      then you won&apos;t have just one point where they all intersect; you will have
      none or infinitely many such points. Multiple equations defining parallel
      lines don&apos;t intersect and don&apos;t span the space; two equations describing
      the same line (one being a multiple of the other, such as <i>y</i>=<i>mx</i>
      + <i>b</i> and 2<i>y</i>=2<i>mx</i> + 2<i>b</i>) will have an
      infinite number of solutions but will not span the space. But this game is
      slightly different: two planes that intersect do span the space, but their
      intersection is a line, not just a single point. To limit the intersection
      of our equations to just one point, we will need another plane that
      intersects the line made by the intersection of the other two (Figure
      19-5).</p>
    <p>Let&apos;s look again at Figure 19-2 as  an example. The two lines in our
      set are described by two equations. To find the intersection of these two
      lines, our task is to find one or more pairs of values for <i>x</i> and
      <i>y</i> that satisfy both of these equations. As you probably have
      guessed, there will be only one such pair of values, the <i>x</i> and
      <i>y</i> coordinates of the one point where these two lines meet. This
      coordinate pair is the <em>solution</em> for this system of linear
      equations.  
   </p>
    <p>To solve the system in Figure 19-2, we can begin by algebraically
      isolating <i>x</i> in one of the equations. Since <i>y</i> = 2.5<i>x</i>
      - 5, then <i>y</i> + 5 = 2.5<i>x</i>, and <i>y</i>/2.5 + 2 = <i>x</i>.
   </p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p>x = <i>y</i>/2.5 + 2</p>
      <p><b>Equation 19-1</b>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We can then take this expression for <i>x</i> and substitute it into
      the other equation:
   </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>y</i> = 1.8<i>x</i> + 1 = 1.8(<i>y</i>/2.5 + 2) + 1 =
        (1.8/2.5)<i>y</i> + (1.8*2) + 1 = 0.72<i>y</i> + 4.6. 
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Proceeding from (1)<i>y</i> = 0.72<i>y</i> + 4.6, we come to 1<i>y</i>
      - 0.72<i>y</i> = 4.6, then to 0.28<i>y</i> = 4.6, and finally to <i>y</i>=4.6/0.28=16
      3/7 or roughly 16.43. This value of <i>y</i> can be substituted into
      Equation 19-1 to give us an <i>x</i> value of roughly 8.57 (8
      4/7). And even though we can&apos;t see their intersection in Figure
      19-2, we can be sure that these two lines cross very near the point
      (8.57,16.43).
   </p>
    <p>This method works well in a two-dimensional space, but linear algebra can
      be applied to as many variables as a person wishes to define and analyze,
      and thus to <q>spaces</q> of 
      many <q>dimensions.</q>  Consider a
      three-dimensional space defined by variables <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and
      <i>z</i> for the quantities of age, height, and weight respectively. An
      equation specifying <i>x</i>=62.5 would be a plane in this space, and
      would span all values of height and weight. If you were younger or older
      than 62.5, then the point corresponding to your place in this space would
      be one on side or the other of this plane. If we add an equation of <i>y</i>=185
      to this system, we have another plane that meets the first at right angles
      and intersects it to form the line of all points (all possible weight
      values) corresponding to the age 62.5 and the height 185. If we added an
      equation specifying a weight, a <i>z</i>-value of 120, this would be a
      plane perpendicular to the other two, and intersecting their common line
      at the point <i>z</i>=120. </p>
    <p>But things aren&apos;t always so simple. Suppose that rather than already
      having a particular age, height and weight in mind, we ask ourselves where
      the intersection of three possibly complex conditions lies. The first
      condition might simply be a specific <i>y</i>-value, height perhaps, as
      shown in the green plane of fixed <i>y</i>-value in Figure 19-6 below.
      But suppose the second condition is a <em>relationship</em> between age,
      height and weight, something like specifying that the weight <i>z</i>
      should be equal to two times the age <i>x</i> minus one-half the height
      <i>y</i>, minus one. This would have the equation <i>z</i>= 2<i>x</i>
      - 0.5<i>y</i> - 1, represented by the red plane above in Figure 19-5 and
      below in Figure 19-6. And suppose the third condition would be some
      similarly complex relationship as well, specifying something that looks
      like the yellow plane in Figure 19-6. We see that such planes do not meet
      at right angles, but there is a point where all three of them intersect.
      What is the quickest way of calculating this point&apos;s specific age, height
      and weight values, given equations for all three planes which define the
      qualifying conditions? How do we know, given such a set of equations with
      no picture to consult, that there is in fact at least one point in the
      space where all of these conditions overlap?</p>
    <p>I would rather not interrupt the current train of thought, but this
      really is an excellent place to broaden our understanding of the principle
      of superposition. A system of linear equations can be thought of as a
      superposition of conditions. In a consistent system, one that actually has
      a solution, each equation describes a property of the system. Graphically,
      we literally place one or more lines or planes on top of another and see
      where they cross over (Figure 19-6). Individually, none of these equations
      will fix the solution at a single point. It isn&apos;t a coincidence that one
      of the ways of describing quantum mechanics mathematically, matrix
      mechanics, involves linear algebra concepts. As we will see in Chapter
      Twenty-Seven, it is common to describe quantum mechanical systems as being
      in a <em>superposition</em> of states. In linear algebra terms, we would
      call a simple superposition of the conditions <i>x</i>=1 and <i>x</i>=3
      <q>inconsistent</q> and look for another variable <i>y</i> or <i>z</i> or
      <i>t</i> that determines the conditions under which the system takes on
      a particular value of <i>x</i>. But when faced with the same ambiguity
      in quantum mechanics, we sometimes don&apos;t do so, and the reasons for that
      are quite interesting. <a name="HiddenVariables">For the last hundred
        years, there has been controversy over the idea of <q>hidden variables</q>
        quantum mechanics and we will discuss that later on.</a></p>

    <p>All right, enough about superposition for now, and back to the challenge
      of finding the intersection of multiple conditions. Suppose that we wished
      to put a fourth dimension, a variable of annual income, into the mix as
      well, and to add an equation which specified the relationship of income to
      the other variables. Perhaps even a fifth or sixth dimension as well. This
      is where linear algebra comes to the rescue. Given a set of equations, you
      standardize them all into a certain form. You give your variables a
      particular order, whether they are <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
      and <i>z</i>, or whether they are <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>,
      <i>x</i><sub>3</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>4</sub>, and so on all the way up
      to <i>x</i><sub>n</sub> for <i>n</i> variables. Then for each
      equation, you label the constant value and the coefficients for each of
      these variables as <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and so on so that
      each equation has the form <i>ax</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>bx</i><sub>2 +</sub>
      <i>cx</i><sub>3</sub> = <i>d</i> . If a
      particular variable (such as <i>y</i>) doesn&apos;t appear in a particular
      equation (3<i>x</i> + <i>z</i> = 2), then its coefficient is zero (3<i>x</i>
      + 0<i>y</i> + 1<i>z</i> = 2). I am going to take the following
      example set of equations and its solution from chapter one of David C.
      Lay&apos;s <cite>Linear Algebra and Its Applications</cite>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>x - 2y + z = 0<br>
        2y - 8z = 8<br>
        -4x + 5y + 9z = -9</p>
      <p><b>Figure 19-7</b>. A system of linear equations.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Once all of these coefficients and constants have been put into a
      standard order in this way, they form a grid called a <dfn>matrix</dfn>,
      with one row of numbers for each equation. We&apos;re going to get to several
      layers of meaning for the matrix, but for now just think of it as a sort
      of scoreboard. Using this matrix to keep track of our progress, the
      intersection game begins. The object of the game is to try to create a
      particular set of values on the left-hand side of the matrix; and if you
      are able to do so, the right-hand side will tell you something useful
      about the system.</p>
    <blockquote>

        back to these terms later.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The object is to get a diagonal row of ones from the top left corner of
      the matrix down to the bottom of the second-to-last column, with only
      zeroes above and below the ones (as in Figure 19-9). This pattern, the
      goal, represents a system of equations in which each variable has been
      isolated, as shown in Figure 19-10. If you can achieve this pattern by
      following the rules, then that final column in your matrix will be the
      coordinates of the one and only point where all these equations intersect.
      The rules of the game are the operations you are permitted to perform on
      the numbers and on the equations that they represent. These allowed
      operations reflect the facts that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the order of the equations in your set is not significant</li>
      <li>you can multiply both sides of any equation without changing its
        meaning</li>
      <li>given any two equations, you can add the two equations or subtract one
        from the other to get another true equation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am not going to walk you through all of the rules here or coach you on
      technique; there are plenty of better resources out there for you. I will
      just be describing how the game is played, sharing a few pointers so that
      you don&apos;t make the same mistakes I did, and telling you the reasons that I
      am a fan. The point of all this is that after the rules have been
      successfully followed and applied to the equations in Figure 19-7, their
      coefficients become ones and zeroes in all the right places (reflecting
      the fact that each equation has one and only one variable in it, and that
      the variables have thus been isolated), and their constant values become
      the solution to the system, as shown in Figures 19-9 and 19-10.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes you can&apos;t get the matrix into this form by following the rules.
      That&apos;s not your fault, it&apos;s simply an indication that there isn&apos;t a unique
      solution to the system of equations. But when there is a unique solution,
      it demonstrates a fascinating property of systems of linear equations:
      look at each column of Figure 19-9 and take notice that each of them is a
      basis vector. The first column is a vector of length one pointing in the <i>x</i>
      direction; the second has the same length in the <i>y</i> direction,
      and the third in the <i>z</i> direction. By definition, if you add 29
      of the <i>x</i> basis vector to 16 of the <i>y</i> basis vector and
      3 of the <i>z</i> basis vector,  you get the position vector
      corresponding to the point in space that is the solution to both this
      simple system of equations and to the one in Figure 19-7. That&apos;s not the
      mind-boggling part. What really amazes me is that the coefficients for the
      original system of equations, as grouped in each of the first three
      columns of the matrix in Figure 19-8, also represent the three basis
      vectors of some alternate coordinate system. Let&apos;s call these basis
      vectors &epsilon;<sub>1</sub>, &epsilon;<sub>2</sub>, and &epsilon;<sub>3</sub>. This coordinate
      system may be much different from our own. The three axes might not all
      meet at right angles, and the basis vectors may not be equal in length.
      But the coordinate axes do cover the entire span of the space, and that
      makes this system good enough to specify any point in the space. The basis
      vector &epsilon;<sub>1</sub>, in terms of its <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>
      components, has the values (1,0,4), as seen in the first column of Figure
      19-8. In the <i>x-y-z</i> coordinate system, this basis vector points
      along no particular axis and has a length of greater than one, but in the
      &epsilon;<sub>1</sub>-&epsilon;<sub>2</sub>-&epsilon;<sub>3</sub> system, it points in the &epsilon;<sub>1</sub>
      direction and has a length of one. Fair enough? The basis vector &epsilon;<sub>2</sub>,
      in terms of its <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> components, has
      the values (-2,2,5); and basis vector &epsilon;<sub>3</sub> has the values
      (1,-8,9).  By now you must be wondering what makes this coordinate
      system special, and what if anything it has to do with the <i>x-y-z</i>
      coordinate system. Here it is: you can make a linear combination of
      the &epsilon;<sub>1</sub>, &epsilon;<sub>2</sub>, and &epsilon;<sub>3 </sub>basis vectors
      to get the vector represented by the last column of the matrix in Figure
      19-8. You take a certain number of &epsilon;<sub>1</sub>, another certain
      number of &epsilon;<sub>2</sub>, and a certain number of &epsilon;<sub>3</sub>, and they
      will all add up to the vector (0,8,9). Well, duh. That&apos;s really the idea
      behind basis vectors; you can combine them to get any vector in the space.
      But how many of each do we need from the first three columns to add up to
      the fourth? That&apos;s the solution to the system. We got the answer by
      manipulating the matrix into the form it has in Figure 19-9. You take 29
      of &epsilon;<sub>1</sub>, 16 of &epsilon;<sub>2</sub>, and 3 of &epsilon;<sub>3</sub>, and
      they will all add up end-to-end to make the vector (0,8,9). This is the
      same thing as illustrated in Figure 19-3, in which four pieces of one
      vector have been added to three of another to make a third. I am going to
      show you now how the mathematical notation for this looks, and we&apos;ll talk
      about it later:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/matrix_mult1.png" style="max-height: 100px;"></p>
      <p><b>Figure 19-11</b> . The coefficient matrix (from Figure
        19-8) times the solution vector equals the column vector that appears
        alongside the coefficient matrix in Figure 19-8. We&apos;ll come back to this
        to explain it.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It&apos;s really amazing; with every recombination of the equations in your
      set &mdash; and by inference, every manipulation of the matrix &mdash; you can switch
      row order, or multiply a row by a constant, or add one row to another. But
      the equality still holds: if the solution coordinates of the system are (<i>x,y,z</i>),
      then <i>x</i> of column one, <i>y</i> of column 2, and <i>z</i>
      of column 3 will get you the vector in column 4. The objective of the
      manipulation is to turn the three left-hand columns into an <dfn>orthonormal
      </dfn> basis, one in which the basis vectors are perpendicular and have
      the same unit length, and in which the basis vectors align with the axes
      of the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> coordinate system. At
      that point the vector in column 4 becomes the solution itself. It&apos;s like
      I&apos;m a kid again, scratching my head and trying to see why 4 times 3 is the
      same as 3 times 4. You are probably having trouble following along
      yourself, so please take comfort in the knowledge that I am going to run
      through this solution multiple times in multiple ways, because honestly I
      am figuring out half of the stuff in this chapter as I am writing it. I
      think it can be helpful to see another person&apos;s mental process, if for no
      other reason to see that everyone struggles sometimes.</p>
    <p>This is the magic trick in linear algebra that has always tripped me up.
      When I first saw it, the questions I was too mystified to even ask were,
       <q>Why do you take all those coefficients along with a column of constants and call them all column vectors?</q> 
      And  <q>A vector is an ordered set of numbers; how can these coefficient columns be vectors if the equations they come from have completely arbitrary order?</q> 
      And  <q>What is the relationship of any of these column vectors to the others, or to the vector that is the solution to the system of equations?</q> And once I
      started to figure it out,  <q>Why do the <i>x</i> coefficients in three different equations become the <i>x, y</i>, and <i>z</i> values of some completely different vector having a completely different basis?</q> It
      all still goes a little over my head, but now I have some of the answers
      and a place to start looking for the rest of them, and so do you. To
      really understand it all, we&apos;ll need to better understand what matrices
      really are.</p>
    <h4>Matrices</h4>
    <p>To learn the secret of matrices, we&apos;ll take a closer look at the ways we
      multiply their parts with one set of numbers to produce another, and thus
      establish the rules for <em>matrix multiplication</em>. We started off
      using matrices as just a way to track our progress as we combined linear
      equations in an effort to isolate variables. This sort of matrix is called
      an <q>augmented matrix</q> because the columns of 
      coefficients are <q>augmented</q>
      with an additional column of constants from the linear equations in our
      set. But then we noticed that a matrix is more than just a scoreboard;
      part of it, the coefficient matrix, can be interpreted as forming a basis
      for a coordinate system.  From my viewpoint, the <em>augmented</em> matrix
      doesn&apos;t have the properties that I generally associate with matrices, but
      the coefficient matrix does. I think of a matrix as something that
      multiplies with other objects, particularly vectors. I will need to
      explain what it means to say the following: the coefficient matrix is what
      we multiplied with the unknown column vector representing the solution of
      the system to get the last vector which was the <q>augmenting</q> part of the
      matrix (Figure 19-11). That isn&apos;t how I described it previously, but that
      is what happens when we combine <i>x</i> of column one, <i>y</i> of
      column 2, and <i>z</i> of column 3. The vector containing the solution
      was a set of weighting values that told us how many copies of each of the
      column vectors in the coefficient matrix to combine to get the final
      vector. Now it&apos;s time to see how that is equivalent to saying that we
      multiplied the coefficient matrix with the solution vector.</p>
    <p>This takes us to the rules of matrix multiplication. Multiplying a matrix
      with some object means multiplying every element in the matrix with an
      element in the other object. Multiplying a matrix with another matrix can
      be very time-consuming, and luckily we won&apos;t need to do it often, if at
      all. We&apos;re going to look at the simpler case of multiplying a matrix with
      a vector, and to keep things reasonable, we&apos;re going to limit ourselves to
      three dimensions. </p>

      matrix and for the elements of a 3-component column vector, and then shows
      how these elements are combined by multiplication of the matrix and the
      vector to create a new vector. Figure 19-13 shows how this set of rules
      was applied to Figure 19-11. And, you will recall, Figure 19-11 was an
      illustration of the relationship between the system of linear equations
      represented in Figure 19-8 and its solution in Figure 19-10.</p>
    <p>Matrices typically are denoted with a capital letter. An equation such as
      the one in Figure 19-12 above, in which the coefficient matrix could be

    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Because I know this is confusing, let&apos;s walk through it all once
        more.</strong> We started with a <q>system,</q> or set, of linear equations
      (Figure 19-7). We put them in a standard form so that each variable
      appeared in the same order and had a <q>coefficient,</q> or multiplier,
      associated with it. We made a 3x3 grid, or <q>matrix,</q> to represent these
      coefficients, and we placed the constant values in the equation
      alongside them to account for them as well (Figure 19-8).  Because we
      weren&apos;t aware of the rules for matrix multiplication at the time, we
      didn&apos;t realize that our system of equations could have been represented in
      the following way:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/matrix_mult3.png" style="max-height: 150px;"></p>
      <p><b>Figure 19-14</b>. The equations in Figure 19-7 rewritten
        in matrix multiplication form.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Assuming that there is only one solution for the system, then at the time
      we began, the variables <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> were <em>constants</em> 
      that we just didn&apos;t know the value of yet. Together, they form a
      column vector that represents the point that is the solution of the
      system. By the rules of matrix multiplication, the coefficient matrix
      multiplies that solution vector to get the vector on the right-hand
      side.  Before moving on, make sure that you can see that the
      equations in Figure 19-7 are represented in the middle and right-hand side
      of Figure 19-14; that you see how the entire system of equations has been
      rearranged on the left-hand side by the rules of matrix multiplication;
      and that you see how the actual values of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>
      shown in Figure 19-13 have been replaced by the variables in Figure 19-14.
   </p>
    <p>Again, this is the part that I have always found most surprising: The
      first column in Figure 19-14 contains all of the coefficients for <i>x</i>
      in all of the equations. In that sense this column <q>belongs</q> to the <i>x</i>
      variable. Likewise for the other two columns of coefficients for the other
      variables. <em>However</em>, it is <em>also</em> true that the values
      in that first column together comprise a vector with significant meaning,
      and that each value in that column is a component of this vector not just
      in the <i>x</i> direction, but in the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> 
      directions. The vertical order of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> 
      is arbitrary in this sense; but if we apply it consistently, we will
      find that the vectors defined by these three coefficient columns have a
      special relationship with the vector of constants on the right-hand side.
      If we make a linear combination of these vectors, making <i>x</i>
      copies of the first, <i>y</i> copies of the second, and <i>z</i> copies
      of the third, then add them head-to-tail, their sum will be the vector on
      the right-hand side. And that will remain true after every time that we
      apply any of the permitted operations to the system of equations &mdash; and by
      extension to each row in the <q>augmented</q> matrix containing the right-hand
      side and the coefficient values. The equations change, but the solution
      remains the same, and the relationships between the matrix and the two
      vectors remain the same. And at this point it won&apos;t be clear at all what
      significance that right-hand vector has, if any.</p>
    <p>By combining equations to isolate the <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>
      variables, the eventual result is that the coefficient matrix becomes
      something called the <dfn>identity matrix</dfn>, which has the special
      property of not changing the value of a vector when a vector is multiplied
      by it. In this respect, it is like the number one which does not change
      any number which is multiplied by it. </p>
    <p>If we are really perceptive &mdash; I have to admit that this isn&apos;t at all easy
      to see yet, and I promise to make it clearer shortly &mdash; we will see at that
      every step of the way, with every recombination of rows in the matrix as
      we isolate our variables, we have had two related vectors, one known and
      one unknown, each vector having a different but known basis; and we are
      solving for the unknown vector by changing the basis of the known one to
      match it.</p>
    <p>Let&apos;s start over from Figure 19-14, where we have the system of equations
      that we started with on the right and their rearrangement into matrix
      multiplication notation on the left. We&apos;ll call the coefficient matrix on
      the left C; the vector of unknowns next to it representing the solution of
      the system will be called <b>s</b>. The last vector on the far
      right will be <b>b</b> , so we have:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>C</i><b>s</b>=<b>b</b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What I&apos;d like to do next is make explicit the coefficients associated
      with the vector<b>b</b>. The identity matrix (the first three
      columns of Figure 19-9) has the special property of being implicit in any
      multiplication, sort of like the number one. It also is arranged so that
      by the rules of matrix multiplication, it will pair a coefficient of one
      with each element of <b>b</b>.  So we can add the identity
      matrix to our equation and its presence will be merely symbolic. Per
      well-established convention, we will denote it with the letter I:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>C</i><b>s</b>=<i>I</i><b>b</b></p>
      <p><b>Equation 19-3.</b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So that we don&apos;t get too mired in the details of row recombination or
      matrix multiplication, I am going to ask you to take my word on what
      follows. Again, this chapter is meant to be used as a supplement or guide
      for your own study of linear algebra rather than a substitute for it.
      Every move you can make in the <q>intersection game,</q> every combination of
      equations you perform to make new replacement equations and new matrix
      rows to represent them, every step you take in isolating your variables in
      pursuit of the solution of the system can be represented by a matrix <i>M</i>
      that you multiply <i>C</i> and <b>b</b> with on each side of
      Equation 19-3:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p>(<i>CM</i>)<b>s</b> = <i>I</i>(<i>M</i><b>b</b>)</p>
      <p><b>Equation 19-4. </b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And for each of these row operations you end up with a new <i>C</i> and a
    new <b>b</b>, multiplied by some matrix <i>M</i>. The solution
    <b>s</b> of course remains untouched, because that is what we are
    solving for. And <i>I</i> is left alone because that is the basis that we
    want <b>s</b> to be expressed in once we have solved it.</p>
    <p>Once again, the surprising property of matrix multiplication that allows
      us to solve this system of equations is that the coefficient matrices <i>C</i>
      and <i>I</i> can also represent sets of column vectors. The matrix<i>
        I</i> contains the basis vectors <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>
      and <b>z</b> associated with the coordinate system we are using
      for the vectors <b>b</b> and <b>s</b>. Each
      of these basis vectors is one unit long and has only one component, and so
      when we represent each of them with column vectors, together they will
      make the identity matrix. Likewise the matrix <i>C</i> can be thought
      of as representing an <em>alternate</em> set of basis vectors somehow
      associated with <b>b</b> and <b>s</b>; and the way
      this basis relates to these two vectors can be defined in two ways. First,
      <b>s</b> can be considered the coordinates of <b>b</b>
      in the basis defined by <i>C</i>. Alternately, <b>s</b> can
      be considered the quantities of each basis vector in C that must add
      together to make <b>b</b>. Either of these is just a way of
      saying that <b>b</b> is a linear combination of the basis
      vectors <i>C</i> as specified by <b>s</b>. When our series
      of row operations succeeds in changing the basis in the coefficient matrix
      on the left hand side to be same as the one on the right, the components
      of the right-hand side vector <b>b</b> became the solution
      values <b>s</b>.</p>
    <p>
      Once we start thinking of matrices as representing either a basis (<i>C</i>
      in the preceding example) or a <em>change</em> of basis (<i>M</i>), we
      are ready to see their role as <em>operators</em> rather than scoreboards,
      and we can begin to understand how they are used to <em>rotate</em> and <em>scale
      </em> sets of different vectors in a consistent manner. In Equation 19-2
      and Figure 19-13, the matrix on the left operates on the vector (29,16,3) to
      return a new vector, (0,8,-9). This operation both rotates the vector
      (changes its direction) and scales it (changes its magnitude). This is
      different from scalar multiplication, which never changes a vector&apos;s 
      direction, and a little more like complex number multiplication, in which
      one complex number can scale or rotate another&apos;s location in the complex
      plane. Matrices can operate on the entirety of the vector space to rotate,
      stretch/squeeze, shear, and/or rescale it; to transform it in some linear
      fashion.  For every such matrix, there is an <em>inverse matrix</em>
      that will perform the reverse operation and restore the vector space to its
      previous state. If a matrix is denoted by a letter such as M, its inverse
      will be denoted as M<sup>-1</sup>.
    </p>

    <p>There are some excellent online resources to help us understand the way
      in which matrices operate on vectors and vector spaces, and I will point
      out some of my favorites. Paul Falstad&apos;s site has an application (<a href="http://falstad.com/matrix/"
        target="_blank">http://falstad.com/matrix/</a>) that allows you to
      manipulate both the bases of a vector space and shows you the resulting
      transformation matrix. I would say more about it, and give more examples
      of transformation matrices, but to really appreciate it, there is no
      substitute for hands-on experience. One last comment on rotations: you
      won&apos;t see it in a numerically-defined matrix like the one in Figure 19-15,
      but a matrix that simply rotates a space by an angle will have elements
      that are the sine and cosine functions of that angle.

    <p>Grant Sanderson, aka <q>3blue1brown,</q> has an absolutely priceless body of
      work on his <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com" target="_blank">website</a>
      and YouTube channel, including a <a href="%20https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab"

        target="_blank">series</a> on linear algebra. The third and thirteenth
      videos in this series relate closely to what we have just been talking
      about.</p>
    <p>There are a couple of terms related to transformation matrices that may
      not come up later in this book, but which you may encounter elsewhere and
      be unnecessarily intimidated by them, so I want give an overview of them
      for you here. A transformation matrix may leave the direction of some
      vectors unchanged. If, for example, the transformation simply stretches a
      space vertically, then the vectors pointing in strictly vertical or
      horizontal directions will not change direction. Vectors whose direction
      is not changed by a particular transformation matrix form a set called the
      <dfn>eigenvectors</dfn> of that matrix (<q>eigen</q> is German in origin and
      translates to <q>own;</q> these are the 
      matrix&apos;s <q>own</q> vectors in some sense).
      The factors by which the eigenvectors&apos; lengths are changed are likewise
      called <dfn>eigenvalues</dfn>. The matrix has easily-calculated
      properties known as the <dfn>trace</dfn> and <dfn>determinant</dfn> which
      will give hints as to the matrix&apos;s eigenvectors and eigenvalues.</p>
    <h4>Operators</h4>
    <p>I&apos;d like to take a moment here to digress very briefly into a discussion
      of the idea of an <dfn>operator</dfn>, because it will be important
      later.  An operator is an idea very similar to that of a function. It
      takes an input and produces an output. Matrices can be considered
      operators that <q>operate on</q> vectors to make a new vector, and this
      paradigm becomes rather significant in quantum mechanics (Chapter
      Twenty-Seven).  A different kind of operator is a differentiation
      operator, for example <i>d/dx</i>, which operates on a function to give
      a new function which is the derivative of the first one with respect to <i>x</i>
      (Chapter Eleven). Another example is the gradient operator (Chapter
      Eleven), which takes a vector field as an input and returns another vector
      field as output.</p>
    <h4>Independence and orthogonality</h4>
    <p>In Chapter Seventeen, I had quite a lot to say about the related concepts
      of orthogonality and independence. Next we&apos;re going to look at how these
      ideas turn up in linear algebra, including a mathematical operation called
      a <dfn>dot product</dfn> that multiplies two vectors together in a way
      that will test whether they are perpendicular. Related to the dot product,
      we will consider the meaning and significance of row vectors. I will also
      make good on my promise to make clearer what I said in Chapter Seventeen
      about basis vectors, row and column vectors, and (in non-orthogonal
      coordinate systems) dual basis vectors.</p>
    <p><dfn>Independence</dfn> in the context of linear algebra is not quite the
      sense of independence I meant to convey in Chapter Seventeen, where I
      related the independence of two variables to the idea of orthogonality. In
      linear algebra, we say that a system of equations is independent if there
      is no equation in the system that can be derived from a combination of the
      others. Put another way, in an independent system there is no equation
      that can be discarded without losing information about the system&apos;s 
      solution. However, if we have <i>n</i> independent equations in a
      system of <i>n</i> variables, then we do have enough information about
      the system to determine its solution; we will be able to transform the
      coefficient matrix from a set of
      not-necessarily-orthogonal-or-equal-in-magnitude vectors to the <em>orthonormal
       </em> (orthogonal and having uniform magnitude of one unit) basis vectors
      of the coordinate system.</p>
    <p>One way of testing whether two vectors are orthogonal is to <em>project
     </em> one onto the other, sort of like shining a light perpendicular to one
      of them and measuring how long a shadow the other one casts on it. This is
      done by computing the <dfn>dot product</dfn> of the two vectors. We already
      covered the cross product in Chapter Eleven, which makes a third vector
      from two vectors. The dot product by contrast makes a scalar from two
      vectors. While defining projection in Chapter Eight, we came close to
      defining the dot product and to showing that definition in Figure 8-13,
      which I will repeat here for the sake of convenience:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/8-13.png" style="max-height: 150px;">
     </p>
      <p><b>Figure 8-13</b> (repeated). The projection of line segment
        <i>a</i> onto the <i>x</i> axis.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Figure 8-13 shows the projection of the vector <b>a</b> onto
      the basis vector <b>x</b>. Since <b>x</b> by
      definition has a length of one, its role in the equation shown is
      implicit. Let&apos;s make it explicit now by rewriting the equation this way:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p>p = <b>ax</b>cos&theta;</p>
      <p>a∙b = <b>ab</b>cos&theta;</p>
      <p><b>Equation 19-5.</b>  <span class="equation_description">The projection p of the vector <b>a</b>
        onto the basis vector <b>x</b> is equal to the lengths of <b>a</b>  
        and <b>x</b> times the cosine of the angle
        between them.</span></p>
      <p><b>Equation 19-6.</b>  <span class="equation_description">The dot product of the vectors <b>a</b>
        and <b>b</b> is equal to the lengths of <b>a</b> and
        <b>b</b> times the cosine of the angle between them.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This projection is calculated the same way as the dot product is
      calculated because they are in fact the same operation. The notation is
      just different, as seen in Equation 19-5 above. We won&apos;t always know the
      angle between two vectors; we might know only the components of the
      vectors. We could make the effort to calculate the angle between them, but
      if all we really want to know is their dot product, there is another way
      of calculating that directly from the vector components. This is one way
      that we encounter the concept of a <dfn>row vector</dfn>. If we take a
      column vector and <dfn>transpose</dfn> it so that it lies on its side,
      then it has a more easily-recognizable rule for multiplying it with
      another (column) vector. We just use the rules of matrix multiplication
      and think of the row vector as a matrix with only one row. Figure 19-16
      shows how to compute the dot product of the vector (x,y) with the vector
      (u,w):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/dotproduct.gif" style="max-height: 75px;"></p>

          target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There is another way of writing the dot product shown in Figure 19-16 .
      If <b>a</b> is a (column) vector with components (<i>x,y</i>)
      and <b>b</b> is another (column) vector with components (<i>u,w</i>),
      we write that we are multiplying the <em>transpose</em> of <b>a</b>,
      the row vector denoted as <b>a</b><sup>T</sup>, with <b>b</b>:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><b>a</b><sup>T</sup><b>b</b>=a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>b<sub>2</sub> = <i>xu</i> + <i>yw</i></p>

        and <b>b</b> written in matrix multiplication form.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is the notation used a couple of chapters ago in Figure 17-6. The
      way that the dot product operation tests for orthogonality is that if two
      vectors are orthogonal, their dot product will be zero. The application at
      <a href="http://falstad.com/dotproduct" target="_blank">http://falstad.com/dotproduct/</a>
      is a good hands-on way to get familiar with dot products.</p>
    <p>There is another application of dot products, and that is to calculate
      the dot product of a vector with itself. This is useful when we don&apos;t know
      the magnitude of a vector <b>s</b> explicitly and must
      calculate that magnitude |<b>s</b>| from the vector&apos;s components
      (s<sub>x</sub>, s<sub>y</sub>, s<sub>z</sub>). In this case, the dot
      product is simply another way of expressing the Pythagorean theorem:</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Before moving on to the next subject, I feel that I should mention that
      there is another way of thinking about row vectors that visualizes them as
      a <em>density</em> in a certain direction. For more on that, check out
      the eigenchris YouTube channel. Speaking of which, this is the point at
      which we come back to the reason I am writing this chapter. We are going
      to introduce a new way of writing a matrix so that we can follow along
      with what eigenchris is going to teach us about changes of basis.</p>
    <h4>Changes of basis</h4>
    <p>In Figure 19-17 (below), we start with Equation 19-3, <i>C</i><b>s</b>=<i>I</i><b>b</b>,
      and in step one, we replace them with all of the numbers written out as in
      Figure 19-11. In step two, we break up each column of the two matrices
      into column vectors. The coefficient matrix <i>C</i> becomes the column
      vectors <b>ê</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>ê</b><sub>2</sub>
      and <b>ê</b><sub>3</sub>. (By the way, it&apos;s common to put
      little <q>hats</q> (^) over the letters for basis vectors, but I haven&apos;t
      figured out an easy way to do that for any given letter.) The
      identity matrix <i>I</i> becomes the <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>
      and <b>z</b> basis vectors. In step three, we combine these
      basis vectors into a <em>row</em> vector <em>containing</em> column
      vectors. So we have changed the notation of each matrix: the matrix <i>C</i>
      is rewritten as the row vector [<b>ê</b><sub>1</sub> <b>ê</b><sub>2</sub>
      <b>ê</b><sub>3</sub>], with each element of that row vector
      itself being a column vector.  Step four is to put these rewritten
      matrices back into the equation so that we have a row vector (of column
      vectors) multiplying a column vector on each side.</p>
    <blockquote><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/matrix_mult8.png"

      <p><b>Figure 19-17.</b>  <span class="equation_description">Rewriting Equation 19-3 and Figure 19-11
        to represent matrices with row vectors.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That&apos;s just the change of notation, and was really where I was going with
      this, but since we&apos;ve gone this far, let&apos;s show how the system of
      equations could have been solved using a single matrix, rather than
      fussing about with a series of row operations, each of which could have
      been represented by a different matrix, as was discussed in the text
      preceding and following Equation 19-4. Maybe the reason they don&apos;t start
      with this technique in  textbooks is because it&apos;s the worst kind of
      cheat, if you don&apos;t bother to learn why it works. Or, perhaps because not
      every system of equations will permit this shortcut; the coefficient
      matrix has to be <q>invertible,</q> which is to say that the system must in
      fact <em>have</em> a solution. Step five is to compute the inverse of <i>C
     </i> using a tool like the one at <a href="https://www.desmos.com/matrix"

        target="_blank">desmos.com</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/matrix_mult7.png" style="max-height: 500px;">
     </p>
      <p><b>Figure 19-18.</b> Inverse matrices <i>C</i> and <i>C</i><sup>-1</sup>
        multiply together to equal the identity matrix.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Then you can call this inverse matrix <i>M</i> and insert it into both
      sides of the equation from step four (lines one and two in Figure
      19-19).  Since [<b>ê</b><sub>1</sub> <b>ê</b><sub>2</sub>
      <b>ê</b><sub>3</sub>] is <i>C</i> and is the inverse of <i>M</i>,
      <i>CM</i> multiplies together on the left-hand side to become the
      identity matrix, or the row vector [<b>x</b> <b>y</b>
      <b>z</b>], as shown on the final line of Figure 19-19. <i>M</i>
      and <b>b</b> multiply together to become the column vector
      (29,16,3) or <b>s</b>, and both sides now match. All of the
      math is included on the end of the last line if you care to check it. What
      we have learned here is that even if the solution s had been unknown, we
      would have gotten it by multiplying both sides of the equation by <i>M</i>,
      the inverse of <i>C</i>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/matrix-mult6.png" style="max-height: 300px;">
     </p>
      <p><b>Figure 19-19.</b> Finding (or verifying) the solution <b>s</b>
        or (29,16,3) by multiplying both sides of the system of equations (as
        shown in Figure 19-11) by the inverse of the coefficient matrix <i>C.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It must be that if we had groped our way through all the row operations
      necessary to isolate the variables in our equations, and if we had kept
      track of each of them as individual matrix multiplications, their product
      when we finished would be that inverse matrix of <i>C</i>.</p>
    <p>Okay, I have rambled on long enough, and it&apos;s time to return to the star
      of this chapter&apos;s show, eigenchris. In the video that I mentioned at the
      beginning of this chapter, he emphasizes that the concepts of <em>covariance
       </em> and <em>contravariance</em> can really be distilled down to a
      balance between opposite changes: one thing grows as its counterpart
      shrinks. And these counterparts are basis vectors on one side and vector
      components on the other. This is the idea I was driving at toward the end
      of Chapter Eleven. </p>
    <p>Instead of the one-dimensional kitchen example I used, eigenchris uses
      the example of a pencil lying diagonally in some coordinate system. The
      vector from one end of the pencil to the other will be a column vector
      with some <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> components, perhaps 3 and 4. Maybe
      our basis is in inches, which would make the pencil 5 inches long (you&apos;ve
      got the Pythagorean theorem down by now, don&apos;t you?). Let&apos;s call our basis
      the row vector <span class="row_vector">[<b>ê</b><sub><i>x</i></sub> <b>ê</b><i><sub>y</sub></i>]</span>
      and our vector components the column vector (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>).
      Multiplying this basis times these components, we get our invariant vector
      <b>v</b>, which represents the physical distance and
      direction from one end of the pencil to the other. The pencil doesn&apos;t care
      what basis we measure it with or what measurements we get on that basis,
      it just <em>is</em>. The right hand side of Equation 19-9 is the
      objective reality, and the left hand side is our way of describing it.</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">

        .</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>There&apos;s nothing wrong with putting the identity matrix in the middle of
      this equation (Equation 19-10) ; it&apos;s like multiplying by the number one.
      But we&apos;re going to replace that matrix by factoring it into two inverse
      matrices.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Now let&apos;s suppose that we change our basis of measurement to be twice as
      big. Then our measurements will be twice as small. We went over all of
      this at the end of Chapter Eleven. But now, thanks to eigenchris, we have
      a useful way of writing that mathematically. We factor the identity matrix
      into two inverse matrices; one will make the basis vectors twice as big,
      and the other will make the components half as big (Figure 19-30).</p>
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <p>These two matrices, the change-of-basis matrix and the
      change-of-components matrix, can switch places if we want to go back from
      the new basis to the old. This works for all sorts of changes to the
      basis, including rotations and even shear transformations such as the one
      shown in Figure 19-15.</p>

    <p>The <i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> of this video is how
      it incorporates he Galilean transformations we discussed in Chapter Six
      and the Lorentz transformations that we haven&apos;t yet looked at for special
      relativity in Chapter Twenty. Both of these changes of physical frames of
      reference or <em>changes of basis</em> can be represented and calculated
      using matrices as well (Figure 19-22):

    <p>Let&apos;s repeat the exercise shown in Figure 19-20, this time beginning with
      a vector <b>s</b> which represents the distance between two
      events in terms of both the time and the distance between them (Figure
      19-23). Going back to the example in Chapter Six, the vector (<i>t,x</i>)
      would be the time and distance Zeno measures between the lump of mashed
      potatoes being released from his hand and their impact on the truck bed.
      We insert two inverse matrices (line two) between Zeno&apos;s basis vectors and
      the measurements he makes between the two events, the two components of
      the vector <b>s</b>. One of these inverse matrices can be
      multiplied with Zeno&apos;s basis vectors to give us the basis vectors for
      Alice&apos;s frame of reference (line three). The other of these two matrices
      can be multiplied with Zeno&apos;s components to give us the components that
      Alice will measure for that same invariant vector <b>s</b>
      (line four).</p>

    <p>Understanding the Galilean transformations in terms of a change of basis
      will put us in a very advantageous position to understand relativity,
      particularly general relativity, in which one often encounters the terms
      <q>covariance</q> and
       <q>contravariance.</q> On that note, let&apos;s revisit the way
      these terms appeared in Chapter Seventeen and clarify their meaning in
      that context. First, let&apos;s recall Figure 17-32:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/dual-basis.jpg" style="max-height: 400px;">

    </blockquote>
    <p>Here we have a coordinate system which the two basis vectors  <b>e</b><sub>1</sub>
      and  <b>e</b><sub>2</sub> seem somehow to not be
      fully independent. As we move to the right along the  <i>e</i><sub>1</sub>
      axis defined by  <b>e</b><sub>1</sub>, we have
      increasing values of   <i>e</i><sub>2 </sub><q>overhead.</q> From
      any point on the  <i>e</i><sub>1</sub> axis, as we move to the right, we
      could draw a line perpendicular to that axis or to   <i>e</i><sub>2</sub>
      and find an increasing value of <i>e</i><sub>2</sub>.
      If   <i>e</i><sub>1</sub> and  <i>e</i><sub>2</sub>
      were variables, we might think they were somehow correlated, like age and
      weight. Infants tend to weigh less than adults; the two variables are not
      fully independent.</p>
    <p>Having a non-orthogonal coordinate system such as this, you may recall
      from Chapter Seventeen, presents us with more than one way to measure the
      components of any given vector; and this is because a measurement parallel
      to one axis is no longer the same thing as a measurement perpendicular to
      the other axis. Parallel and perpendicular measurements become distinct
      methods with distinct results. In an orthogonal coordinate system we have
      (covariant) basis vectors  <b>e</b><sub>1</sub> and 
      <b>e</b><sub>2</sub> and contravariant components which we can
      call <b>v</b><sup>1</sup> and <b>v</b><sup>2</sup>;
      the difference in the placement of the indices, being in sub- or
      superscript, indicates co- or contravariance. In a non-orthogonal system,
      those bases and components still go together, and are the results of the
      <q>parallel</q> method; we measure components by tracing a line parallel to one
      axis and seeing where it crosses the other. We can see in Figure 17-32
      that the two components, no longer perpendicular to each other, still add
      up to the same vector, but in the shape of a parallelogram rather than a
      square. But in this non-orthogonal system we also have the <q>perpendicular</q>
      method of measurement; and in order to get two components that still add
      up in this way to make up the vector in question, we must trace a line
      perpendicular to one of the axes and seeing where it crosses not that
      axis, but its <em>dual</em> axis as defined by its <em>dual</em> basis
      vector. We&apos;ll get to how this dual axis and basis is defined in a moment,
      but for now take a look at Figure 17-32 and observe the parallelogram
      formed by <b>v</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>v</b><sub>2</sub>;
      its neighboring sides are vectors that add up to make <b>v</b>,
      but if these to sides did not continue <em>through</em> the system&apos;s two
      axes to be measured on these dual axes, that would not be so. So the dual
      basis is what makes the perpendicular method of measurement work. It has
      these two properties: first, <b>e</b><sub>1</sub> is
      perpendicular to the dual basis vector <b>e</b><sup>2</sup><sub>
      </sub> and <b>e</b><sub>2</sub> is perpendicular to 
      <b>e</b><sup>1</sup> . Second, each basis vector also has a
      relationship with its own dual vector such that their dot product is one.
      In other words, the greater the angle between them, the greater the
      difference in their magnitudes, and as one becomes larger the other must
      become proportionally smaller. The dual basis vectors are thus <em>contravariant</em>,
      and accordingly, their indices go <q>upstairs</q>:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><b>e</b><i><sub>n</sub></i> ∙ <b>e</b><i><sup>n</sup></i>
        = <b>e</b><i><sub>n</sub></i><b>e</b><i><sup>n</sup></i>cos&theta;
        = 1</p>
      <p><b>Equation 19-11</b>.  <span class="equation_description">The definition of dual basis vectors.</span>
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Because of the first property, when the system is orthogonal, the angle
      between a basis vector and its dual is zero, and in that case the second
      property makes them equal in size as well; they are in essence the same
      vector. At the risk of sounding pedantic, the duality is a consequence of
      the non-orthogonality. At the risk of both interrupting the flow of
      thought and sounding cryptic, in the chapters that follow, I will try to
      communicate the idea that it is a similar non-orthogonal relationship, a <em>non-independence</em>
      between time and space (and the corresponding basis vectors <i>x</i>
      and <i>t</i>), that creates the duality of past and future, as seen
      (previously) in our light cone diagrams and (coming up) the dual
      square-root solutions to a squared vector quantity called the spacetime
      interval.</p>
    <p>Back to the here and now: note in Figure 17-32 that the
      contravariant/upstairs-indexed vector components get paired with the
      downstairs-indexed/covariant basis vectors, and vice versa. Covariance and
      contravariance also determines which transformation matrix to apply when
      changing the basis: one matrix applies to the (contravariant) vector
      components and the (contravariant) dual basis vectors, and the inverse of
      that matrix applies to the (covariant) basis vectors and the covariant
      (dual) components.</p>
    <h4>Metric tensors</h4>
    <p>I have <q>finished</q> writing this chapter more than once, only to find in
      the process of writing a subsequent chapter that there&apos;s another thing I
      ought to have included here. I think we&apos;re getting close to the end, but
      there is something that we will need for Chapter <i>i</i><sup>2</sup>
      when we learn about vectors in the context of relativity, and that is to
      learn the relationship of the dot product operation to the <em>metric
        tensor</em> concept in Chapter Seventeen.</p>
    <p>I think it&apos;s worth our time to have a quick review of what the metric
      tensor represents, which is a way of expressing how distances may be
      calculated from their coordinates. We started in Chapter One with the
      Pythagorean theorem, <i>c</i><sup>2 </sup>= <i>a</i><sup>2
      </sup>+ <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>, then in Chapter Seventeen we
      generalized this to <i>c</i><sup>2 </sup>= 1<i>a<sup>2</sup></i><sup></sup>
      + 0<i>a</i><i>b</i> + 0<i>b</i><i>a</i><sup> </sup>+ 1<i>b<sup>2</sup>
     </i> = 1<i>aa</i><sup></sup> + 0<i>a</i><i>b</i> + 0<i>b</i><i>a</i><sup>
      </sup>+ 1<i>bb</i>. In other words, we included every possible ordered
      combination of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, and gave them explicit
      coefficients of zero or one as appropriate. You might reasonably ask why
      we would want to keep track of the zero terms, and we&apos;ll get to that
      shortly. If we were talking about <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates
      in a Cartesian system rather than sides <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of a
      triangle, we would write that the magnitude <i>s</i> of a vector with
      components <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> was calculated as follows: <i>s</i><sup>2
      </sup>= 1<i>xx</i><sup></sup> + 0<i>xy</i> + 0<i>yx</i><sup>
      </sup>+ 1<i>yy</i>.</p>
    <p>We then arranged all of these coefficients into a 2x2 matrix which we
      called the metric tensor:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/tensor4.png" style="max-height: 100px;">
<br> <b>Figure 17-22</b> (repeated). The metric tensor
        for flat Euclidean space in Cartesian coordinates (also known in linear
        algebra as the identity matrix).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We also made ourselves a key, a visual reference for pairing the numbers
      in the metric tensor with the coordinate combinations they were the
      coefficients for. This key was an index:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/t3neg.jpg" style="max-height: 100px;">
     </p>
      <p><b>Figure 17-21</b>  (repeated). A key for
        the indices of metric tensors in terms of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We found that in coordinate systems having non-orthogonal bases, that all
      combinations of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> became relevant, and
      correspondingly that there would be no zero elements in the metric tensor.
      We&apos;re going to fudge a little bit now, and let <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> stand
      for the contravariant components in this coordinate system without
      changing them to generalized coordinates having superscripts for index
      values, as we did in Equation 17-2.</p>
    <p>By the law of cosines (<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>
      + <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> - 2<i>ab</i>*cos&phi;), the length <i>s</i> of
      a vector having components <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>  and an angle &phi;
      between its coordinate axes is calculated as follows:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>s</i><sup>2</sup> = 1<i>xx</i><sup></sup>
        -2cos<i>&phi;xy</i> + 1<i>yy =</i> 1<i>xx</i><sup></sup>
        -1cos&phi;<i>xy</i> -1cos<i>&phi;</i><i>yx</i><sup> </sup>+ 1<i>yy</i></p>
      <p><b>Equation 19-12.</b>   <span class="equation_description">The length of a vector in terms of its
        contravariant components <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> and the angle &phi;
        between them.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And so we ended up with this metric tensor containing all the
      coefficients specified in Equation 19-12, in the order shown in Figure
      17-21.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/tensor7take2.png" style="max-height: 100px;">
       </p> <b>Figure 17-33</b> . A metric tensor for use
      contravariant vector components in a system with non-orthogonal coordinate
      axes. 
      </blockquote>
    <p>Using the index key in Figure 17-21, we could refer to the elements in
      this metric tensor by their index values G<i><sub>xx</sub></i>, G<i><sub>xy</sub></i>,
      G<i><sub>yx</sub></i> and G<i><sub>yy</sub></i>. Then we could rewrite
      Equation 19-12 this way:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>s</i><sup>2</sup> = G<i><sub>xx</sub>xx</i><sup>
        </sup>+ G<i><sub>xy</sub></i><i>xy</i> + G<i><sub>yx</sub></i><i>yx</i><sup>
        </sup>+ + G<i><sub>yy</sub></i><i>yy</i></p>
      <p><b>Equation 19-13.</b>   <span class="equation_description">The length of a vector in terms of its
        contravariant components <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> and the metric
        tensor.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>With an understanding now of the dot product, it&apos;s time to re-examine
      Figures 17-21 and 17-33 as representing the <em>dot products</em> of the
      coordinate system&apos;s <em>basis vectors</em>. The dot products of every
      combination of basis vectors are specified in Figure 17-21, and the
      computed values of these products are shown in Figure 17-33 in the same
      order as shown in Figure 17-21. In orthogonal coordinate systems, any <q>off-diagonal</q>
       elements (elements having indices which are not equal) in
      the metric tensor are zero because they involve the dot products of two
      different basis vectors, as seen in Figures 17-22 and 17-23 (Chapter
      Seventeen). In a flat, orthogonally-defined space, the metric tensor is
      the identity matrix. The metric tensor in Figure 17-33, on the other hand,
      belongs to a non-orthogonal coordinate system and thus all the dot
      products of its basis vectors are non-zero.</p>
    <p>In a flat, orthogonal coordinate system, the metric tensor can be left
      out or understood as implicit because its multiplicative value is like the
      number one; it has no effect when multiplying a vector.  Equation
      19-8, in which we find the magnitude <i>s</i> of a vector by computing
      its dot product with itself, could be rewritten to make the metric tensor
      explicit, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/row-matrix-column.png" style="max-height: 100px;">
 </p>
      <p><b>Equation 19-14</b> .  <span class="equation_description">Using the dot product to compute the
        magnitude of a vector from its components, using the identity matrix as
        the metric tensor.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In curved or non-orthogonal systems, we <em>have</em> to include the
      metric tensor explicitly, and so in this case we find the dot product in
      this way:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><b>|s|</b> <sup>2</sup> = <b>s</b> <sup>T</sup>G<b>s</b> </p>
      <p><b>Equation 19-15.</b>   <span class="equation_description">The magnitude of the vector <b>s</b> 
        where G is the metric tensor.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <p>In the system shown in Figure 17-32, we would find the magnitude of <b>v</b>
      in terms of its contravariant components <b>v</b><sup>1</sup>
      and <b>v</b><sup>2</sup> by using the metric tensor this way:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/dotr-product-affine.png"
          style="max-height: 80px;"><br> 
        <b>Equation 19-16</b> .  <span class="equation_description">Using the dot product to
        compute the magnitude of a vector <b>v</b> from its
        contravariant components, using the metric tensor in Figure 17-33.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And this would give us the same results as we see in Equations 17-2 and
      17-4:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p>|<b>v</b>|<sup>2</sup> = (<b>v</b><sup>1</sup>)<sup>2</sup>

      <i>At the Non Sequitur</i> </h3>
    <p>In a restaurant and karaoke bar overlooking the Oyster Ground of the
      North Sea, an immediately-recognizable figure entered the lobby. Seeing
      him in person for the first time, Alice caught her breath.  <q>We&apos;re so 
	  delighted you were able to meet us, Dr. &hellip; <em>Albert</em>,</q> she said,
      still in awe of the fact that she was not only meeting the legendary
      Einstein, but that he wished to be on a first-name basis with her. 
      She had decided not to tell him that she had named one of her cats after
      him, as that would seem embarrassing and weird. <q class="dialog">As you may have surmised, I am Alice, 
	  and this gentleman is my friend Zeno of Elea. Zeno, Dr. Albert
      Einstein.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog"><i>Sehr angenehm</i>, Zeno. Please call me Albert.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">The pleasure is mine, Albert. Delighted to meet you.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">I hope that you both enjoy this place,</q> Alice said as the group
      continued to the reception podium.  <q class="dialog">It&apos;s new, owned by an old friend of mine from England.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">It&apos;s always the right time at the Non Sequitur,</q> said the hostess.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Thank you. Alice, a table reserved for three if you would be so kind.</q>
      Alice tried not to beam too obviously over the accomplishment of this
      tremendous social feat. Being a famous netcaster has its benefits:
      Einstein had gotten word of being mentioned on Episode Fourteen and had
      reached out shortly afterward. <q class="dialog">I hope we aren&apos;t too early.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Welcome,</q> the hostess replied cheerfully. She glanced down at the
      reservations list and made a note next to Alice&apos;s name. The antique desk
      that the list lay on was made of a dark and well-polished wood. A tasteful
      placard at the front read <q>All ages welcome.</q> The overall elegance of the
      furnishing was marred by someone having scratched the words <q>Never more</q>
      into the writing surface, and by these words having been crossed out.
      Alice noticed the graffiti just as the hostess led them away to their
      table, and wondered if it had been made by a disappointed patron on his
      way out. There was another thought nagging at her though, as she kept up
      with the casual chat between Einstein and Zeno, and this thought was like
      a sneeze she could be done with if only the light were adequate.</p>
    <p>At the microphone, a woman who looked as if she had just stepped out of a
      Vermeer painting and a black man wearing robes and a jeweled turban were
      singing a duet that they obviously found humorous:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> 
        <q><i>Unsure forever, lost in space<br>
          Mysterious transit; steps leave no trace<br>
          If I change what I ask, the prior answer is erased<br>
          Give to me momentum; take from me my place &hellip;</i></q></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Alice recognized the tune but was unfamiliar with the words. She looked
      around as if in expectation. There were movie posters on the wall, but
      Alice did not recognize most of them: <i>Looper, Tenet,</i> and <i>
        Donnie Darko</i>, among others. <i>Groundhog Day</i> seemed to ring
      a bell.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Unfortunately, the boss was called away on some urgent business; he
      sends his regrets.</q> the hostess said to Alice&apos;s great disappointment, but
      in anticipation of the question she had at that moment begun speaking
      aloud:</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Is Theo &hellip;?</q> Alice asked. <q class="dialog">Oh. Pity. Please give him our best regards.</q></p>
    <p>Three well-dressed fraternity types were seated at the bar. The one in
      the middle was obviously drunk and upset, and his companions at either
      side seemed most solicitous in consoling him and completely unsuccessful
      in hushing him. There being very little room elsewhere, Alice, Zeno and
      Einstein were seated at the table nearest these other three.</p>
    <p>In a confidential tone, Zeno spoke to those at the table:  <q class="dialog">If I am not very much mistaken, 
		the loud young man behind me is Hamlet, heir to the throne of Denmark.</q></p>
    <p>Glancing discreetly in the prince&apos;s direction, Alice had a hunch that
      Zeno was right.  <q class="dialog">My maths tutor mentioned him to me once; he knew Hamlet as a philosophy student at Oxford before Hamlet transferred to another school on the continent. I can&apos;t recall the name of it.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">A philosopher prince!</q> Einstein exclaimed. <q class="dialog">How very commendable.</q> He
      then reminisced aloud regarding his happy experience at Oxford.</p>
    <p>At the bar, Rosencrantz was doing his best to provide grief counseling to
      Hamlet.  <q class="dialog">As you wish it, my Lord and good friend. But I humbly submit that you would greatly benefit from the company and the blessed distraction of a woman.</q></p>
    <p>The advice seemed to fall on deaf ears. Guildenstern rolled his eyes at
      Rosencrantz as Hamlet continued to stare some hundreds of yards through
      the assortment of bottles at the bar.  <q class="dialog">Let us have a merry song!</q>
      Guildenstern proposed, then led the trio of schoolmates in an irreverent
      song <!--link to video here--> about the drinking habits of the great
      philosophers.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">I like this place very much,</q> Zeno said to Alice and Einstein.
       <q class="dialog">It has an atmosphere like the one I have long imagined for another place that I    
		have read about &hellip;</q> Zeno raised his voice slightly to make himself heard    
	   above the singing, which at that moment asserted that
        <q>Wittgenstein was a beery swine.</q></p>
    <p>Zeno continued:  <q class="dialog"> &hellip; but have never managed to get to yet, the Restaurant at the End of the &mdash;</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Wittenberg!</q> Alice finally recalled. 
      <q class="dialog">Hamlet transferred from Oxford to <em>Wittenberg</em>. Terribly sorry to have interrupted, Zeno. Do go on.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Think nothing of it,</q> Zeno said.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">I say, that&apos;s rather a slanderous song, isn&apos;t it?</q> asked Alice.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Perhaps,</q> Zeno said. 
       <q class="dialog">But I know more than a few of those men, and I wouldn&apos;t say that the lyrics miss the mark in every case.</q> Hearing the
      names of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, and keeping an ear out for the
      mention of his own, he did not know whether he would be more offended over
      what the song might say about him, or more offended not to have been
      included at all.</p>
    <p>The Wittenberg students concluded their singing, then ordered another
      round of ale, and their merriment gradually subsided. At the table next to
      them, Einstein was recounting the intellectual path that led him to
      relativity:  <q class="dialog"> &hellip; and at last it occurred to me that <em>time</em> was suspect!</q> he exclaimed.</p>
    <p>Overhearing this, Hamlet stood and turned to address the other group in
      heavily accented English, beginning enthusiastically but then forgetting
      his train of thought and muttering grumpily to himself in his native
      language. <q class="dialog">The time is out of joint! O cursed &hellip; <em>Line!</em></q>
      <!--link to play here--></p>
    <p>At this, a lone cloaked figure in a booth at the edge of the room nearly
      choked on his tea, then tried to look inconspicuous.</p>
    <p>Einstein had recently learned the English idiom <a href="section_1.html#OutOfTrue">"out of true"</a> for carpentry frames having non-perpendicular joints, and
      his thoughts went immediately to his former math professor&apos;s <a href="#FigureII-1"
        target="_blank">spacetime diagrams</a> upon hearing the philosopher
      prince uttering a similar phrase referring to time and then making an
      obscure reference to a <q>line.</q>
       <q class="dialog">How interesting that you should say so, young man,</q> Einstein replied.
        <q class="dialog">My Danish isn&apos;t very good, but my friends in Copenhagen do me the kindness of conversing with me in German. As you no doubt overheard, my dinner companions and I have English in common with you. When you say that time is out of joint, are you referring to the non-orthogonal relationship of time to space?</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Your &hellip; Danish?</q> Hamlet asked, unsteady on his feet.
        <q class="dialog">I am sorry for your misfortune. I highly recommend the ale.</q></p>
    <p>Expressionless, Einstein and party looked on in awkward silence. Hamlet
      stifled a belch, then burst out laughing.  <q class="dialog">I jest. Salutations, wise Einstein. Your fame is great at Wittenberg.</q> With half-crossed eyes, he
      then extemporized:  <q class="dialog">The time was out of joint! Oh, blessed fate, that you were ever born to set it &hellip;</q> At this, Hamlet faltered and his schoolmates
      lunged forward to steady him.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Please excuse &hellip;</q> said Rosencrantz, his thoughts changing tracks as he
      truly noticed Alice for the first time and looked her over, then turned
      his gaze on Hamlet.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog"> &hellip; the prince.</q> continued Guildenstern. <q class="dialog">He recently lost &hellip; </q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog"> &hellip;  his girlfriend?</q> Rosencrantz interjected, speculatively.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">That <em>hasn&apos;t happened yet</em>,</q> Guildenstern hissed.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">You can&apos;t <em>know</em> that, because we aren&apos;t <em>in Elsinore.</em></q>
      Rosencrantz countered. <q class="dialog">Ask <em>him,</em></q> he said with a jerk of his
      head toward Einstein. <q class="dialog">Or read Poincar&eacute;. He&apos;ll tell you the same.</q>
      Switching to Danish, the two of them continued arguing in loud whispers.
      The prince gave Alice a wan smile as his companions led him off in the
      direction of the restrooms.</p>
    <p><em>That may be the most ridiculous pair I have seen since Tweedledee and
        Tweedledum</em>, thought Alice.</p>
    <p>Einstein, having intuited Rosencrantz&apos;s point despite being ignorant of
      its context, was reminded of a conversation he once had with Henry Ford;
      he was considering recounting it to his dinner companions when Alice
      finally saw the significance of what she had seen upon entering the lobby,
      and clapped her hand to her forehead. Realizing that she ought to have
      recognized her friend&apos;s handwriting, she exclaimed:  <q class="dialog">Ugh!  <q>How is a raven like a writing   desk?</q> That dear fool!</q>
      <!--links to both texts here?--></p>

    <h3 id="SpecialRelativity">Chapter Twenty<br>
      Special Relativity </h3>
    <p>We have done a great deal of preparation, and now we are ready to explore
      relativity, one of the two great revelations of modern physics. I trust
      that you are already familiar with the name Albert Einstein, author of the
      theory; and I think it likely that you have already read other books or
      articles on relativity. After all, I wouldn&apos;t be writing this book if I
      hadn&apos;t done so myself and come away not quite satisfied. Indeed, I hope
      that you have consulted or will consult a variety of other sources for
      their perspectives on relativity.<!--, and I will have some recommendations for
      you. Reminder--> I am confident in this book&apos;s ability to offer a new
      and insightful approach to relativity. As a reader, you will bring your
      own particular preconceptions and understandings to bear on the material
      that follows here, and there isn&apos;t a particular order or level of detail
      that will suit everyone equally. I say this not by way of justifying my
      own particular approach, but as something that you should keep in mind
      lest you become discouraged in your reading. I sometimes lack some
      necessary patience and often come to a new subject with a set of questions
      already in mind, wanting to find their answers in a particular order, and
      that approach doesn&apos;t always serve me well. If this material is new to
      you, you may want to <q>put a pin</q> in the points that you don&apos;t quite
      understand, to keep reading and see what does become clear, and then
      return. I have been pondering relativity for longer than I care to say,
      and I still find new and interesting ways of seeing it.</p>
    <p>At the time Einstein developed relativity, he was a well-educated
      physicist not yet having completed a PhD. He was working as a patent clerk
      in Switzerland, a country famous for its clocks. At the beginning of the
      20th century, as the world was rapidly becoming better connected by rail
      and telegraph lines, new ways of synchronizing clocks were being invented.
      Einstein&apos;s office was required to review patent applications that dealt
      with such technological challenges. Henri Poincar&eacute;, a French
      mathematician, had professional responsibilities that likewise placed him
      at the forefront of the world&apos;s efforts to synchronize itself. As early as
      1898, Poincar&eacute; questioned the meaning of simultaneity over large distances
      and wrote that there may not be a meaningful, universally applicable time.
      There can be little doubt that Einstein was familiar with Poincar&eacute;&apos;s 
      insight in this area, and he is likely to have discussed it among his
      peers in the years preceding the 1905 publication of his first paper on
      relativity.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <p>James Maxwell&apos;s work on electromagnetism was still new when Einstein
      considered its meaning as a teenager. Particularly, Einstein wondered what
      it would be like to observe light from a perspective that kept pace with
      it as it raced through space. Einstein&apos;s imagination suggested that it
      would behave as a standing wave in which the electric field increased and
      decreased, peaking in the same locations that would remain at rest
      relative to the observer. But, he realized, Maxwell&apos;s equations did not
      seem to allow for light that stood still with respect to an observer in
      this way. So he dug deeper.</p>
    <p>During Einstein&apos;s boyhood, scientists had endeavored to detect the
      <q>ether,</q> the presumed medium through which light waves propagated &mdash; the
      thing that did the <q>waving.</q> Without water, there are no water waves.
      Remove the air from a test chamber containing a tight balloon, and there
      is nothing to carry the sound waves when the balloon pops. All waves have
      to be a disturbance of <i>something</i>. The idea of a <q>luminiferous</q>
      (light-bearing) ether was invented to give light some sort of medium to
      travel through in the otherwise empty space between the stars. Albert
      Michelson and Edward Morley conducted a series of experiments designed to
      detect the ether and which failed to do so, but failed in a useful way;
      they all but proved that there was no such ether, leaving it for someone
      like Einstein to boldly suggest that the speed of light as predicted by
      Maxwell is constant <em>relative to any observer*</em>, not relative to
      any universal frame of reference such as the ether. This is a satisfying
      conclusion for its egalitarianism, but it has some stunning consequences
      that require us to change our intuition. (*More precisely, the speed of
      light is constant relative to any <em>unaccelerated</em> observer, in
      other words one at rest or in uniform motion. We&apos;ll get to the case of
      accelerating reference frames later.)</p>
    <p>Einstein presented the theory of relativity in two parts: first was what
      came to be known as <q>special relativity,</q> or relativity in the special
      cases of uniform relative motion. This was followed by  <q>general relativity,</q> which covered not only uniform motion but accelerated motion
      as well. We&apos;ll introduce special relativity first, with its surprising
      predictions, often-intimidating mathematics, and enormous philosophical
      implications. In this chapter I hope to make special relativity appear
      less strange by showing its consistency and symmetry both within itself
      and in comparison to the other subjects covered so far; in this and the
      following chapters I will also outline a less challenging mathematical
      perspective and debunk some of the shakier philosophical ideas which
      relativity has fueled.</p>
    <p>Let&apos;s do a quick review of some of the major points we have covered
      already:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Apparent size varies with distance and viewing angle (perspective,
          Chapter Three)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Apparent spatial order is reversed by rotation (the balls on the
          number line, Chapter Five)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Apparent temporal order varies with location in space (the clock
          array scenario, Chapter Seven)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Time is local, not global. Apparent synchronization cannot be made
          global; it can be created locally only at the expense of true global
          synchronization. (the clock array scenario)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Apparent time rate (frequency) can also vary with relative motion
          (the Doppler effect, Chapter Six)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Measured distance varies with relative velocity (Galilean
          relativity, Chapter Six)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Several quantities vary inversely with the square of the distance
          from a center point: the area of a sphere; the intensity of light; the
          forces of gravity, electrostatic force, and magnetism; the angular
          velocities of a series of points measured perpendicular to the
          direction of motion (Chapters Nine and Ten).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Magnetism is caused by movement of electric charges and changes in
          voltage. Electric force may be measured partially as magnetic force
          depending on the relative motions of the source and the observer
          (Chapter Twelve).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Magnetism, unlike electric charge, is apolar. It only appears polar
          when circular currents occur within a closed surface and measurements
          are taken outside that surface (Chapters Nine and Twelve).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Circular motion (revolution) and spin (rotation) are equivalent as
          forms of angular motion (Chapter Twelve).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Periodic motion is a more general category of behavior  that
          includes rotation and is represented by a pair of sine waves. Each of
          the waves represents alternation between two opposites; each pair of
          opposites relates closely to the other. Examples are: front-back and
          top-bottom; left-right and clockwise-counterclockwise; north-south and
          east-west; positive-negative divergence and positive-negative curl.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The very concepts of space, time, and causality require a universal
          maximum <q>speed limit</q> (Chapter seven). This speed happens to be the
          speed of light.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <!--List the postulates?-->The crux of Special Relativity is the law that
      all unaccelerated observers will measure light in open space to have the
      same speed, no matter what their speeds are relative to each other. For
      this reason, Einstein at times referred to his theory as one of
      <q>invariance.</q>
      <!--(Ferris 193, III-23)  But be careful. The term relativity is in the 1905 paper-->A
      key consequence of this invariance is that at relative speeds near the
      speed of light, two observers&apos; measurements of the space and time between
      events must differ, in order for their measurements of the speed of light
      remain to constant. Here is an example similar to the one that first
      impressed on me the strangeness of the theory of relativity:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>If observer A is in a space station and observer B flies by at 100,000
        miles per second in their rocket ship with their headlamps illuminating
        the path in front of them, the light from the lamps will have a certain
        speed. To observer B, the light goes forward from their own rocket ship
        at the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second. To observer A, the
        light will <em>not</em> have the simple sum of this velocity and the
        velocity of the rocket ship (186,000 + 100,000 = 286,000 mi/sec). The
        light must still be measured to go at 186,000 miles per second.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>How paradoxical this seems! But if we discard the idea of a universal
      time shared by all observers, we can imagine a logically consistent way
      for this to be true. Each observer must measure the other&apos;s clock (or any
      other apparatus of time measurement) to be running slow, and the other&apos;s 
      <q>yardstick</q> (or any other apparatus of spatial measurement) to be
      shortened <u>in the direction of their relative velocity</u>. Indeed,
      each observer will measure their counterpart to be narrower in that one
      dimension and to be aging less slowly; this reciprocal <em>measurement</em> of
      diminished size is similar to (but more profound than) the reciprocal 
      <em>perception</em> of diminished size when two people pass on the sidewalk and recede
      toward the horizon. This difference in measurements of time and space will
      be what we explore in this chapter.</p>
    <p>There is more than one way to compare the length of a moving yardstick to
      a moving one. We could build a measuring grid with the yardstick and then
      set the grid up on the other side of the stick as it passes us by and take
      a high-speed photograph to see how far apart the two ends are, like the
      way the doorway at your local convenience store may be marked to measure
      the height of a bandit making a getaway. Or, in a way that seems somewhat
      paradoxical at first, we could attach a camera to the stick and have it
      photograph <em>us</em> against the measuring grid as it passes by, then
      use it again to measure us again when we are at relative rest.  
  </p>
    <p>On the face of it, this may seem rather ridiculous, that moving clocks
      should run slower than clocks at rest and that moving objects should be in
      some respect shorter than when they are at rest. And it isn&apos;t just
      clockwork that must run slowly as a consequence of relativity; <em>all</em>
      physical processes having the same velocity in our frame of reference are
      slowed to the same rate. But from Einstein&apos;s point of view, his
      conclusions were inescapable, given the facts known at his time. And
      relativity has been experimentally confirmed over and over again. So how
      did we come to this point in the history of science, where <q>common sense</q>
      longer seems quite so sensible? Here we will follow Einstein&apos;s reasoning,
      and by the time we are done, we should find our former <q>common sense</q>
      replaced by a better sense of reality.</p>
    <p>As mentioned in Chapter Six, concerning classical relativity, each
      observer measures time and space using a particular <em>basis</em>: a
      master clock and one or more measuring-sticks or number lines each
      pointing in an independent direction of space. This basis defines our
      coordinate system in time and space. But just as two observers may have
      differing orientations in space, we find in relativity that there is no
      universally applicable standard of time. And we will find that the
      differences between two systems of measurement are rather <em>unlike</em>
      our common sense of rotation, orientation, and scale.</p>
    <h4>Time and motion</h4>
    <p>Times being what they were when Einstein developed relativity, he often
      proposed <q>thought experiments</q> using the movement of trains as examples.
      But I prefer a different metaphor; <strong>the more I think about
        relativity, the more I become convinced that the key to understanding it
        deeply, and to developing an intuition for it, is an idea called the
        <q>light clock.</q></strong> 
        This idea was introduced in a short <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Principle_of_Relativity,_and_Non-Newtonian_Mechanics"
        target="_blank">paper</a> by Gilbert Lewis and Richard Tolman in 1909<!--Orzel 149-->.
      A light clock is an imaginary device consisting of two facing mirrors, at
      a fixed distance from one another, between which rays or pulses of light
      may be reflected and timed. One trip back and forth between mirrors by a
      pulse of light is one tick of the clock; the opposing mirrors ensure that
      the clock keeps ticking. Because the essence of relativity is the
      realization that all unaccelerated observers must measure the same value
      for the speed of light, the light clock is a most appropriate means of
      envisioning the measurement of time. Furthermore, it makes some of the
      consequences of relativity apparent in a very simple geometric way.</p>
    <p>Imagine such a light clock as a pair of mirrors lying parallel to the
      ground, one low and one higher (Figure 20-2). If the mirrors are one foot
      apart, a beam of light will be able to cross the gap between them in
      roughly one nanosecond. We can imagine that each such crossing is a <q>tick</q>
      of this clock. Imagine now that the mirrors are set in very fast motion
      along the ground. If a beam of light is sent across the gap to strike the
      same point on the opposite mirror as before, it must now travel not only
      that same vertical foot, but an additional distance along the ground. If
      the speed of light is to remain constant, it must travel that longer
      distance in a longer time, greater than one nanosecond. And indeed it
      does; we thus measure that the clock ticks more slowly. As the mirrors get
      closer to the speed of light, the light pulse traveling between them must
      use more and more of its velocity just to keep up with the mirrors rather
      than making the crossing between them. However, if someone is  <q>riding along</q> with the clock, they will notice neither a change in the distance
      the light travels (because this distance is perpendicular to the direction
      of motion) nor in the time it takes to get there, because it has to move
      at the same speed for all observers. The conclusion is that for the speed
      of light to be measured equal by all unaccelerated observers, moving
      clocks must run more slowly. Any other clock the ride-along observer may
      take with them will run at the same slower rate as the light clock
      itself.</p>
    <p>You may ask, as I did,  <q>Why is that? What if they take a clock that runs mechanically on pendulums and gears rather than a pulse of light between two mirrors?</q> And well you should ask. The experimental fact is that the
      moving clock does run slower. None of the parts of any clock, light clock
      or otherwise, would be able to exceed the speed of light in their attempt
      to keep up with the mirrors, and it turns out that even a slow-moving
      mechanical clock enjoys no advantage in that respect. Any mechanism that
      would keep time is only able to keep up with the mirrors in the light
      clock, rather than proceed with its normal function once everything is
      moving fast enough in a single direction. Maybe the more productive
      question is to ask,  <q>What does all matter have in common with a light clock?</q> Is mass somehow similar to the energy we know as light? In the
      chapters that follow, I won&apos;t be able to show that all mass is in fact
      just light energy bouncing back and forth across some invisibly small
      distance. But what I will do is describe a hypothetical system in which
      that (or something very much like it) is true, and then demonstrate that
      many of the surprises we find in modern physics are not only completely
      consistent with that hypothesis, but more importantly, that they are more
      easily understood in that context.</p>

    <p>You may study this strange <q>thought experiment</q> of 
      the <q>light clock</q> with
      great skepticism, looking for an inconsistency in the logic until you say,
       <q>Aha! But what about a pair of mirrors whose light pulses travel and are reflected <em>in the direction of the mirrors&apos; motion</em>?</q> This does have
      the result that a stationary observer will measure a shorter distance
      between the moving mirrors, but as the clock moves faster, they will still
      see that the clock slows down as the light pulse between the mirrors
      struggles more and more to catch up with the mirror moving ahead of it.
      The orientation of the clock does not matter.</p>

        paths between events A and B.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Nor does the size of the light clock matter; in fact, in a system having
      several clocks of different sizes but in uniform collective motion, all of
      the clocks will keep pace with each other, slowing down as measured by an
      observer in relative motion. Look at the light cone diagram in Figure
      20-3, to which I have added a grid of <q>light-like</q> lines (gray)
      representing the paths that light might take in this plane if it radiates
      outward from a body at rest between events A and B. Let us imagine that
      this body is wide in relation to the diagram, and that the blue line
      represents the center of its mass over time. Let&apos;s suppose that the
      narrow, green, zig-zagging path is the path taken by a beam of light in a
      small light clock that forms part of this body; and that the orange path
      corresponds to the light in a somewhat larger clock that is also part of
      the body. We see that the smaller clock <q>ticks</q> three times while the
      larger one completes half a tick. This is due to the distance between the
      mirrors in each clock, which you can see in the diagram is six times
      greater for one clock than the other. This will all be accounted for in
      the calibration of the clocks, if they are used to tell time. We could
      even suppose that if we looked closely enough at the blue path, we would
      find that it was not straight, but that it was rather a zig-zagging path
      of much smaller width and higher frequency. <a name="ComeBackHere"></a>The
      point of all this is that no matter how many <q>clocks</q> comprise this body
      as a system, and no matter the distance between the individual pairs of
      mirrors, if the system moves at a speed near the speed of light (along one
      of the black lines at the edge of the diagram), all the light beams in all
      of the clocks will be required to move in the same direction to keep up.
      This is no trick of sophistry or mathematics; high-precision clocks have
      verified this behavior experimentally. Nor does the design of the clock
      have any particular bearing on the result; whether the clock in question
      is a light clock or an atomic clock, time truly does run more slowly for
      moving frames of reference, and we will need to spend some time discussing
      what we mean by this.</p>
    <p>In one sense, we might say that everything moves at a constant speed, the
      speed of light, through something called <q>spacetime;</q> that all bodies at
      rest relative to us experience time at this particular speed, and that the
      faster we see a body move through space, the slower it appears to move
      through something we call <q>time,</q> with its clock slowing down as a
      consequence. We might then conclude, as many have done, that time is a 
      <em>fourth</em> dimension in a physical sense. But look again at Figure 20-3. What
      we call <q>time,</q> the ticking of various sorts and sizes of clocks, may be
      nothing more or less than oscillatory movement through the old, familiar 
      <em>three</em> dimensions of space. If <em>everything</em> is considered to be
      always moving at the speed of light, with only part of that motion being
      macroscopically visible, then a <em>fourth</em> dimension of time
      becomes superfluous because in some sense we already have three of them.
      Again, I am not going to assert that all matter is essentially a light
      clock, because then I would have to explain what the mirrors are made of,
      or how the light beam in the clock can reflect itself, and that is beyond
      my expertise (although I will show in Section Four how some of the great
      minds of science seem to have suggested just such a thing). But this view
      of the physical world can serve us very well at least as an analogy.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, if time were merely a dimension in addition to the three we
      already have, then we would expect motion in this <q>dimension</q> to be
      independent of motion in the other three. If you are in a train and want
      to pass a book to someone seated across the aisle, it doesn&apos;t matter to
      either of you how fast the train is going. The motion of the book and the
      motion of the train are a simple superposition in any frame of reference.
      This is not the case between time and space. When an object is pushed to
      give it a greater relative velocity in our frame of reference, that push
      slows down that object&apos;s clock. Its motion in <q>time</q> is dependent in some
      way on its motion in space, such that these two motions must always add to
      the speed of light. We&apos;ll analyze this relationship over the next few
      chapters.
  </p>
  <p>Before going more deeply into the surprising things predicted by relativity,
    it is important to make and repeat some distinctions. Appearance is
    different from measurement. In Chapter Seven, we made this clear with the
    chimes and pistols sounding or appearing to be out of sync when they
    actually were synchronized. In Chapter Three, we noted that relative 
    <em>displacement</em> affects <i>perception</i> of size but not the measurement of it.Relativity requires that relative <em>velocity</em> affects the <i>measurement
      </i>of size. We have seen how relative spatial placement will affect
    whether certain <i>objects</i> are measured to be arranged one behind the
    other, right-to-left, or left to right. As we shall soon see, relativity
    requires that relative velocity will affect whether certain <i>events</i>
    (A and B) are measured to be simultaneous, A before B, or B before A.</p>
    
    
    <p>Finally, we mustn&apos;t confuse <em>places</em> or <em>objects</em> with <em>events</em>.
      A place is a location in space. An event is a specific place at a specific
      time. An object is neither of those things; it is a relationship between
      places and times. To <q>do</q> relativity, we must de-couple our sense of
      events from our sense of objects, like a drummer learning to keep two
      simultaneous rhythms. The two ends of the object that is your drumstick
      don&apos;t necessarily belong to the same time. The stick always has two ends,
      but the relationship between those ends is mediated by time. You push on
      one end of the stick, now, and the other end moves, later. The two ends
      occupy different <em>events</em> in a way that is more than just their
      separate <em>places</em>. As we shall soon discuss, the time order of the
      events happening on either end of the stick may vary depending on who is
      measuring. As a result, the stick itself may appear shorter to a moving
      observer, while events on the stick may seem to occur further apart.</p>
    <h4>Length and simultaneity</h4>
    <p>The second aspect of special relativity, in addition to the difference
      or the rate at which two observers experience and measure time, is the
      difference between how they measure length. This difference also has its
      basis in the fact that time is measured differently between observers; not
      only do their clocks run at different rates, but if they each carry with
      them two clocks which they have synchronized in their frame of reference,
      and if the clocks lie on the fore and aft sides of the observers&apos; motion
      relative to one another, each observer&apos;s clocks will appear out of sync to
      the other. In other words, the two observers will disagree on what events
      are simultaneous. To me, the event of my first clock being in front of me
      and reading exactly 12:00 is simultaneous to the event of my second clock
      being to my rear and reading exactly 12:00. And I measure these two clocks
      as being one meter ahead of the other. But to someone going in the
      opposite direction at high speed, those two events are not simultaneous.
      For them, what is simultaneous to the event of my first clock, in front of
      me, reading exactly 12:00, is <em>not</em> the event of my second clock
      being one meter to the rear of the first and reading exactly 12:00; it is
      the event of my second clock, behind me and slightly less than a meter
      behind my first clock, reading just a little after 12:00. That third
      event, being later in time as I would have measured it, is naturally
      forward in space as we both measure it, because the clock is moving
      forward with me. The other observer and I both agree on <em>where</em> my
      second clock read exactly 12:00, and where it read slightly past 12:00; we
      just don&apos;t agree on what other events were simultaneous with each of
      those. The distance between the two clocks is diminished for the other
      observer because what is simultaneous to me is not simultaneous to
      them.  And exactly the same thing is true in reverse; I measure that
      the other observer&apos;s clocks are out of sync, closer together, and running
      slowly.</p>
    <p>As we compare one frame of reference to another, it is vital that we
      remain conscious of the distinction between the <em>basis</em> of
      measurement in a given frame and the <em>directions and magnitudes</em>
      of measurements (for a refresher on this, see the ends of chapters Eight
      and Eleven). A change from one frame of reference to another means a
      change of basis vectors, and therefore an opposite  (<q>contravariant</q>)
      change to the measured components of any given vector. If our basis, or
      measuring stick, is shortened by some factor 1/&gamma;, then all of our
      measurements will increase by the same proportion and have a new value
      1*&gamma;. So as we observe the meter-sticks (or basis vectors) of a
      reference frame moving relative to ours to have shrunk, we will know that
      measurements between events made by observers in that reference frame will
      come out proportionally larger. Likewise with their clocks having slowed;
      they will measure more time between events than we do.</p>
    <h4>Quantitative analysis</h4>
    <p>Now that we&apos;ve covered the <q>what, why, and how</q> of special relativity,
      let&apos;s look at the <q>how much.</q> As is often the case with physics, there are
      multiple ways to introduce the math. I am going to spoil the surprise and
      state right away that it simply comes down to the cosine of the angle <i>&theta;</i>
      in Figure 20-2, the light-clock diagram. There are far more uglier ways to
      write the math, and I don&apos;t want these to put you off before you have seen
      the simpler version. I will explain both formulations so you can recognize
      either of them when you see them and understand how they relate.</p>
    <p>The historical approach to the math would involve explaining that even
      after the Michelson-Morley experiments, there were some who still wanted
      to save the idea of the ether; they didn&apos;t succeed in that, but one of
      them nevertheless came up with a formula that became useful in relativity.
      H. A. Lorentz theorized that an observer&apos;s motion through the ether
      actually caused him and his instruments to shorten in the direction of
      motion. That, he supposed, was why the observer always measured light to
      have the same speed in all directions. The <q>Lorentz factor</q> is a somewhat
      unsightly mathematical expression, but Einstein found it ready-made for
      relativity and it does indeed represent the degree to which one observer
      finds the measurements of another observer in relative motion to be
      lengthened in the direction of motion. According to relativity, the
      observers themselves do not merely <i>appear</i> but are mutually <i>measured</i>
      to be proportionally smaller. This is how they can both agree on the speed
      of light.</p>
    <p>The <q>Lorentz factor</q> is complex enough to be represented a number of
      ways. Sometimes it is symbolized by the Greek letter gamma (&gamma;). Sometimes
      it is shortened by using the letter beta (<i>&beta;</i>) to stand for the ratio
      of relative velocity to the speed of light (<i>v</i>/<i>c</i>). In
      this form, the Lorentz factor is <img class="equation" loading="lazy" src="images/lorentz_abbr.png"

        style="max-height: 45px;">. Unabbreviated, it takes the form:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><img class="equation" loading="lazy" src="images/lorentz.png" style="max-height: 85px;"></p>
      <p><b>Equation 20-1</b>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Notice that when <i>v</i> (the relative velocity of another system or
      frame of reference) is zero, or at least much less than the speed of light
      <i>c</i>, the Lorentz factor is one or near one. Multiplying anything by
      one has no effect; that means that at low speeds, the Lorentz factor does
      not have significant effect. But as <i>v </i>reaches significant
      fractions of <i>c</i>, the Lorentz factor becomes large enough to notice.
      As <i>v</i> approaches <i>c</i>, the factor gets very large indeed, and
      where<i> v=c</i> it results in division by zero, which is undefined. This
      reflects the fact that nothing other than light (or other forms of
      electromagnetic radiation) may go at the speed of light.</p>
    <p>I am going to set aside this form of the Lorentz factor for the moment
      and instead look at one of its mathematical reformulations, which to me
      seems more fundamental and approachable. If we return to Figure 20-2, we
      see that the light reflecting from the mirrors of the light clock does so
      at an angle <i>&theta;</i> with the vertical line that meets the mirrors
      perpendicularly. When the clock is at rest relative to us, we measure this
      angle to be zero. It turns out that the Lorentz factor can be rewritten as
      1/cos <i>&theta;</i>.</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>&gamma;</i>=1/cos <i>&theta;</i></p>
      <p><b>Equation 20-2</b>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To see how this is so, we will change our units of measurement to
      simplify our calculations. As I have said before, constants in equations
      tend to distract from the important relationships between the variables.
      Since the speed of light is a constant and the truest measure we have, it
      would make perfect sense to set <i>c</i> equal to one and adjust our
      units of measure accordingly. In meters per second, <i>c</i> is 2.998 x
      10<sup>8</sup>. In other words, light travels about 300,000 km per second.
      Expressed in light-years and years, <i>c</i> is simply 1. A light-year
      is the distance light travels in one year, which is very far indeed. Light
      years and years are good measurements for an astronomical scale. For
      measurements on earth, we might choose a system of nanoseconds (ns) and
      light-nanoseconds (about one foot). Let&apos;s use the abbreviation <q>cns</q>
      for light-nanosecond(s).</p>
    <p>Suppose we have a measuring stick which is one <i>cns</i> in length.
      This is the distance light travels in one nanosecond, being at the
      constant speed <i>c</i>. Let us also suppose that we have another
      instrument in the shape of a carpenter&apos;s square.
      <!--"Your assigned square"-->Each arm of the square is also 1 <i>cns</i>
      long at the inside, and each arm is marked in hundredths of a <i>cns</i>.
      Moving our square to measure the stick, we can match the length of the
      stick exactly on either arm.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/20-4.png" style="max-height: 175px;">
    </p>
      <p><b>Figure 20-4</b>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We can also place the square diagonally so that with the stick it forms a
      right triangle. In this way, the stick touches each arm at a certain
      length. As the length on one arm decreases, the length on the other
      increases. These lengths can vary between zero and one <i>cns</i> and
      always add so that the sum of their squares is one.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/20-5.png" style="max-height: 175px;">
    </p>
      <p><b>Figure 20-5</b>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now we will have the length of this stick represent a velocity vector,
      and we will label it <i>c</i>. We will arbitrarily pick one arm of the
      square to represent the velocity <i>v</i> measured between us and another
      observer in uniform motion with respect to us. Labeled <i>v</i>, the
      measurement along this arm represents the distance (in light-nanoseconds)
      traveled by the other observer in one nanosecond. We will label the other
      arm <i>w</i>, <i>w </i>being a quantity also having units of
      light-nanoseconds per second and having a significance which we will
      establish shortly. The angle opposite <i>v</i> we will label as <i>&theta;</i>.
      This gives us a right triangle with sides of length <i>c</i>, <i>v</i>,
      and <i>w </i>(Figure 20-6).</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/20-6.png" style="max-height: 185px;"></p>
      <p><b>Figure 20-6</b>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Let&apos;s put our measurement system to work now. If we measure the other
      observer to be at rest, then we place our square so that <i>v</i>=0 and<i>
        w</i>=1. Now let us suppose that the other observer is in motion with
      respect to us at half the speed of light. We place our square so that one
      end of the stick touches the <i>v</i> arm at 0.50 and so that the other
      end touches the <i>w </i>arm. What does the <i>w</i> arm measure? It
      happens to give us the factor by which we will find the other observer&apos;s 
      clock to have slowed. <i>w </i>is equal to 1/&gamma;, which in this case is
      about 0.87; so we and the other observer will each measure the other&apos;s 
      clock to be running only .87 times as fast as our own/their own. By this
      fortune of nature, we have a nice visual aid for relating <i>v</i> to <i>&gamma;</i>.<i>
      </i>We can move our measuring square from side to side and see how the
      inverse of the Lorentz factor changes with relative velocity.</p>
    <p>There is a mathematical relationship here which we can use to write the
      Lorentz formula into something more intuitive. In Figure 20-6, since<i> c
      </i>is equal to one and <i>w</i> is measured in the same units as <i>c</i>
      (light-nanoseconds per second), we could also say that <i>w </i>= c/&gamma;<i>.
      </i>So, using trigonometry, we find that where <i>v</i>/<i>c</i>=sin
      <i>&theta;</i><i>,</i> the Lorentz factor <i>&gamma;</i> is 1/cos <i>&theta;</i>. This
      <i>&theta;</i> is the same angle labeled as such in Figure 20-2.</p>
    <p>So we find that the other observer&apos;s <em>macroscopic</em> speed <i>v</i>
      through space comes at the expense of their experience of <q>time,</q> which we
      might consider their <em>microscopic</em> speed through space <i>w</i>:
      the ticking of their light clocks, the orbits of their constituent
      electrons around their atomic nuclei, and so on. In our triangular diagram
      these speeds add like perpendicular vectors: <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>w</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>.
      The vector <i>w</i>, a speed through <q>time,</q> adds to the perpendicular
      vector <i>v</i>, a speed through <q>space,</q> to give us <i>c, </i>a speed
      through <q>spacetime.</q> But if we were able to look closely enough, it might
      turn out that it&apos;s all really only space. As a dimension, time is <em>imaginary</em>,
      and shortly we will see how this is so in a very mathematical sense.</p>
    <p>But this is not all; cos <i>&theta;</i> also gives us the amount by which
      we will find the other observer to be contracted in the direction of our
      relative motion. Not only does the other observer&apos;s clock run at 87%
      speed, they are also only 87% as long in that one direction as we would
      measure them to be if we were at rest in relation to them. This
      diminishing length corresponds mathematically to the diminishing aspect of
      objects in a rotated perspective (in Figure 3-4, a face of a block looks
      shorter or longer when rotated).</p>
    <p>There&apos;s something very peculiar about this relationship that may not be
      apparent yet, and I want to prevent giving the wrong impression here. In
      Figures 20-4 through 20-6 we are doing something that looks familiar but
      is in fact quite different from what it may look like. We should be
      accustomed by now to taking any two arbitrary vectors and adding them to
      make a third.  This is simply superposition as we have come to
      understand it. It&apos;s even simpler when these vectors are at right angles to
      one another. We can add any velocity vector <b>a</b>  which
      points in the <i>x</i> direction and add it to a velocity vector <b>b</b>  
      in the <i>y</i> direction to get a third velocity vector <b>c</b>  
      having a length which depends on the lengths of its two
      components. If the <b>a</b>  is larger, then <b>c</b>  will
      be larger. If <b>b</b>  is larger, then <b>c</b>  will
      be larger.</p>
    <p>But Figure 20-6 is not like that, because the magnitude of <b>c</b> 
      is <em>fixed</em>; it is a <em>predetermined</em> sum for <b>v</b> and
      <b>w</b>. If <b>v</b> gets larger, <b>w</b> must
      become smaller. If <b>w</b> becomes larger, it&apos;s because <b>v</b>  
      got smaller. This is not a simple superposition like we deal with
      in all the areas of physics we have discussed up to now. In Chapter Six,
      the amount of time it took for Zeno&apos;s lump of mashed potatoes to fall to
      the ground was not thought to be in any way dependent on whether he stood
      on the side of the road or whether he was standing on the back of a truck;
      and it didn&apos;t matter whether the measurement was taken from aboard the
      truck or by someone the truck was passing. The fall of the lump and the
      motion of the truck were independent and could be added together in a
      simple superposition. But in relativity, we see that this is not exactly
      so. The difference was too subtle to have been measured at the modest
      speed of the truck, but if their measurements could have been made
      accurately enough, Alice would have measured more time in the fall of the
      lump from her position at the roadside than Zeno would have measured from
      the back of the truck. While in relative motion, Alice would say that
      Zeno&apos;s clock was slow; Zeno would say the same of Alice, and that the
      force of gravity on the lump was stronger than Alice measured it to be.
      But that takes us into the subjects of relativistic mass/energy, and I&apos;d
      like to save that for <a name="ComeBackToThis345">a little later</a>.
      What I&apos;d like to emphasize for now is that velocities which were simply
      added in superposition in the classical paradigm &mdash; including the speed of
      clocks &mdash; do not add that way in relativity.</p>
    <p>To summarize: where the velocity <i>v</i> of another observer as a
      fraction of the speed of light is sin <i>&theta;</i>, their contraction factor
      <i>w</i> is cos <i>&theta;</i>. In some abstract sense, the same angle <i>&theta;
     </i>  that is formed between a light beam bouncing off of its mirror and
      the <q>normal</q> (perpendicular) of the mirror&apos;s surface is also an angle
      formed between two frames of reference when they are in motion relative to
      one another. As <i>v/c</i> (<i>&beta;</i>) approaches the limit of 1
      (nothing can go faster than <i>c</i>), <i>w</i> approaches zero (the
      object in motion shrinks to a depth near zero). An increase in an object&apos;s 
      velocity changes its orientation with respect to us such that it is
      measured to be smaller in the direction of its velocity. It is <i>as
        though</i> objects at rest in relation to us face us directly so that we
      measure their full aspect; objects in motion are rotated so that this
      aspect is diminished. But, as shown earlier, this measured difference in
      size has to do as much with differences in simultaneity as it does with
      some sense of rotation.</p>
    <p>
      To summarize further: what I am calling the <q>contraction factor</q> <i>w</i>
    is the inverse of the Lorentz factor &gamma;. The contraction factor is the rate
    at which a moving clock will run in proportion to its speed at rest, and its
    volume in proportion to its volume at rest (being contracted in one
    direction, the direction of relative motion, by that factor).

    <h4>Lorentz transformations</h4>
    <p>So how does this Lorentz factor come into play? Mind you, we are still
      talking about uniform relative motion, that is, frames of reference in
      which neither observer is accelerating. The Lorentz factor is used to
      gauge how much our measurements of time and distance will change from one
      frame of reference to another. With the Galilean transformations which we
      learned in Chapter Six, we transformed the measurements of two coordinate
      systems in uniform relative motion in this way:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>x</i>&prime; = <i>x</i>-<i>vt</i></p>
      <p><i>t</i>&prime; = <i>t</i></p>
      <p><b>Equations 6-1 and 6-2.</b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If someone else has velocity <i>v</i> along the <i>x</i> axis of my
      frame of reference, I could use the above equations to reconcile my
      measurements with theirs. We did this exercise in Chapter Six with the
      dropping lump of mashed potatoes. At low speeds &mdash; that is, speeds much
      less than the speed of light &mdash; the Galilean transformations work just
      fine. This is because the <i>v</i>/<i>c</i> part (or <i>&beta;</i>
      part) of the Lorentz factor is near zero, making the factor as a whole
      nearly equal to one. But at higher speeds, where <i>v</i>/<i>c</i> becomes
      larger, the Galilean transformations no longer work if both observers are
      to measure light to have the same speed in all directions. For high
      speeds, the Lorentz factor (<i>&gamma;</i>) must be included:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>x</i>&prime; = <i>&gamma;</i>(<i>x</i>-<i>vt</i>)</p>
      <p><b>Equation 20-3.</b></p>
      <p><i>t</i>&prime; = <i>&gamma;</i>(<i>t-vx/c</i><sup>2</sup>)</p>
      <p><b>Equation 20-4.</b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Equation 20-3 shows how the distance <i>x</i>&prime; between two events as
      measured by one observer will differ from the distance <i>x</i>
      measured by an observer in relative motion along the <i>x</i> axis at
      velocity <i>v</i>. If an observer who measures a distance of <i>x</i>
      between the events also measures them as being simultaneous (<i>t</i>=0,
      therefore also <i>vt</i>=0), then a second observer in relative motion
      will measure a distance of <i>x</i>&prime; which is simply <i>x</i> times
      the Lorentz factor. Note that this is the distance between two <em>events</em>,
      not the measured length of some moving object. We will measure a moving
      object to have shrunk in the direction of its motion, because what is
      simultaneous to us is not simultaneous to an observer in that object&apos;s 
      reference frame. But given specific non-simultaneous <em>events</em> to
      measure a distance between, the distance that we measure between those
      events will be <em>greater</em> than the distance measured by an
      observer for whom the two events are simultaneous.</p>
    <p>Equation 20-4 shows how the time <i>t</i>&prime; between two events as
      measured by one observer will differ from the time <i>t</i> measured by
      an observer in relative motion along the <i>x</i> axis at velocity <i>v</i>. 
      If an observer who measures a time of <i>t</i> between the
      events also measures them as being local (<i>x</i>=0, therefore also <i>vx/c<sup>2</sup></i>=0),
      then a second observer in relative motion will measure a greater time
      difference of <i>t</i>&prime; between the events which is <i>t</i> times
      the Lorentz factor.</p>
    <p>Note what happens if we replace <i>v</i> in this pair of equations
      with its equivalent <i>&beta;c </i>(<i>c</i>*<i>v/c</i>): the time
      coordinate <i>t</i> becomes <i>ct</i>, which has the same units of
      distance as <i>x</i>, and the equations become symmetrical:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>x</i>&prime; = <i>&gamma;x - </i><i>&gamma;</i><i>&beta;(ct)</i></p>
      <p><b>Equation 20-5.</b></p>
      <p><i>ct&prime;</i>= <i>&gamma;(ct) </i><i>- </i><i>&gamma;</i><i>&beta;x</i></p>
      <p><b>Equation 20-6.</b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Since the Lorentz transformation equations are linear in terms of <i>x</i>
      and <i>t</i>, they can be written in terms of transformation matrices,
      as seen in Chapter Nineteen. Since not all of us are going to be all that
      into the math, and since eigenchris does such a beautiful job of
      explaining it all, I won&apos;t delve more deeply into that just yet, and for
      now refer you to eigenchris&apos; YouTube series on relativity, specifically

    <p>Here is an example of differences of measurement between two coordinate
      systems. You and your friend drive cars which are both fifteen feet long.
      When you are stopped side by side or traveling at the same speed, each of
      you measures the other&apos;s car to be fifteen feet long. Using the above
      formula, the Lorentz factor is one when your relative velocity (<i>v</i>)
      is zero.</p>
    <p>To make all this easier to visualize, let&apos;s suppose that the speed of
      light were only 60 miles per hour (about 44 feet per second). You are
      stopped at a traffic light, but your friend comes up alongside you just as
      the light turns green and passes you at 30 miles per hour (22 feet per
      second). The Lorentz factor for this relative speed, half the speed of
      light, is 1.15, as shown in Table 20-1.</p>
    <p>So if each of you now were to measure the distance between two events
      which are simultaneous in your frame of reference, the other would find
      the distance between those two events to be 15 percent larger; and the two
      events would not be simultaneous in the other observer&apos;s frame of
      reference.</p>
    <p>Because each of you measures the front and rear ends of the other&apos;s car
      at offset times rather than times which are simultaneous to the driver of
      the car, the other&apos;s car is measured to be shrunken along the direction of
      your relative motion. At relative speeds of one-half the speed of light,
      you measure your friend&apos;s car to be 1/<i>&gamma;</i>, or 87 percent, as long as
      your own.</p>
    <p>While you are stopped at the traffic light, suppose you have your hazard
      lights blinking. To you, the lights in the front and rear of your car
      blink on and off at the same time. But to your friend, they do not blink
      simultaneously. Your front lights lead your rear lights slightly, even as
      he comes alongside you. If your friend has his hazard lights on, you will
      measure the same thing, but in reverse. His rear lights lead his front
      lights. There is a fundamental reality upon which both of you will agree.
      You both agree on the speed of light. You will not agree on the length of
      your cars, namely the spatial distances between the two simultaneous
      events of <q>front</q> and
       <q>rear,</q> nor on the time between all events. But
      there is something else you will agree on, which is the combined <em>space-time</em>
      distance between the events. You will agree, for instance, on the combined
      space-time distance between the particular events of the individual lights
      blinking on or off. I will explain what this space-time distance means and
      how it is calculated shortly.</p>
    <p>Let&apos;s establish a three-dimensional coordinate system to better analyze
      the problem. The street you and your friend are traveling on will be our <i>x</i>
      axis. The intersecting street is the <i>y</i> axis, and a line
      perpendicular to the plane of the intersection is the <i>z</i> axis.</p>
    <blockquote>

      <p><b>Figure 20-7.</b> A street intersection with three Cartesian axes.
        Length Δ<i>x</i> between two blinking hazard lights.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Let&apos;s focus on just one blink of your hazard lights, and just on the
      right-hand side of your car where your friend passes by. The blink of the
      right front light is one event, and the blink of the right rear light is
      another.</p>
    <p>For you, the distance between the two events is 15 feet along the <i>x</i>
      axis. You measure no difference along the <i>y</i> or <i>z</i> axes,
      and no difference in time.</p>
    <p>For your friend, the difference in time is about two tenths of a second,
      which means he is measuring the events at two different times. It works
      out that the distance between the two events is 17.3 feet in his moving
      frame of reference. The two (simultaneous) ends of your car he measures at
      13 feet apart, but since the events of the blinking lights are not
      simultaneous to him, he has moved slightly in the interim and this extends
      the measurement in his frame of reference. Though he finds the length of
      your car &mdash; the distance between two <em>places</em> &mdash; shortened by the
      Lorentz factor (the length of your car is multiplied by 1/<i>&gamma;</i>), he
      finds the distance between the two <em>events</em> to be <em>lengthened</em>
      by the Lorentz factor (length is multiplied by <i>&gamma;</i>). If each of you
      had large clocks on the ends of your cars and each of you synchronized
      your own clocks, you would see a time difference between the two clocks on
      the other car. You each measure the other car to be shorter because from
      the other person&apos;s perspective you are measuring the leading end of their
      car first and then the trailing end later, even though in your frame of
      reference you are measuring both ends simultaneously. How do we
      mathematically reconcile your measurements to those of your friend? With
      the rules of geometry.</p>

    <h3 id="Chapter_i2">Chapter <i>i</i><sup>2</sup><br>
      Imaginary Geometry </h3>
    <p>For all the disagreements over space and time measurements between
      observers, there <em>is</em> a quantity that they all can agree on besides
      the speed of light, and that is something called the <dfn>spacetime interval</dfn>. 
      And luckily for us, it isn&apos;t much more difficult to
      calculate than a Pythagorean (vector) sum of perpendicular distance
      components. What follows in this chapter are some of our most useful
      mathematical tools in analyzing relativity, which also happen to be some
      of its greatest conceptual stumbling-blocks. We&apos;ll talk about what these
      tools are, how they are useful, where they came from, and how they can
      lead us astray if we misinterpret them. Throughout this chapter, keep a
      close eye on not only how calculation of the spacetime interval is much
      like a simple vector sum in three dimensions, but also the important ways
      in which it is <em>different</em>.</p>
    <p>In the Pythagorean theorem&apos;s application to Cartesian coordinate systems,
      the distance <i>s</i> separating two places is calculated using the
      formula <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>z</i><sup>2</sup>. To our
      three dimensions of space, though, we must add the imaginary dimension of
      time if we are to measure the combined space-time distance between <i>events</i>.
      So our total <q>space-time</q> distance will be <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup>
      + <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> + (<i>it</i>)<sup>2</sup>. When I said that time was imaginary in
      a  mathematical sense, this is what I meant. Here we see the
      imaginary number <i>i</i>, the square root of minus one, attached to our
      <q>time coordinate</q> <i>t</i>. In the scenario which we are continuing
      from Chapter Twenty, we are measuring space in feet and time in seconds,
      so to make our units match up, we have to add in a factor for the speed of
      light (<i>c</i>) which in our fictitious case is 44 feet per second. Where
      <i>c</i>=44, <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>z</i><sup>2</sup>
      + (<i>ict</i>)<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p>Now that I have made my point about time as we understand it being
      imaginary in some sense, I am going to change our formula to its more
      modern standard form. We&apos;re going to refactor it so the squared <i>i</i> appears
      outside the parentheses in the last term as the value negative one, so
      that (<i>ct</i>)<sup>2</sup> is now subtracted rather than added.</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>s</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> - (<i>ct</i>)<sup>2</sup></p>
      <p><b>Equation ii-1</b>.  <span class="equation_description">A typical modern form of the equation
        for the spacetime interval. Note that when <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>
        are zero, this simplifies to <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> - (<i>ct</i>)<sup>2</sup>,
        which sharply contrasts to the Pythagorean sums <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> =<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>
        + <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> or <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup>. A
        Pythagorean sum is the equation of a circle, and the spacetime interval
        is more akin to the equation of a hyperbola (Chapter Thirteen).</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Using the Pythagorean theorem, or at least our imaginary-component
      modification of it as it applies to spacetime (Equation ii-1), you
      calculate the interval between the events of your front and rear hazard
      lights blinking. You measure fifteen feet of separation on the x axis, and
      no difference in time:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>s</i><sup>2</sup>= 15<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> -(44*0)<sup>2</sup> = 225</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Measuring 17.3 feet of separation and two-tenths of a second between the
      events, your friend calculates:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>s</i><sup>2</sup>= 17.3<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> -(44*0.20)<sup>2</sup> = 17.3<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup>+ 0<sup>2</sup> -(8.66)<sup>2</sup> =
        225</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The square root of 225 is 15, so both of you will agree that if the two
      events had been measured in a frame of reference where they were
      simultaneous, the distance <i>s</i> between them would be 15 feet apart.
      This 15 feet is called <q>proper distance</q> between the two events (though
      <q>rest length</q> and
       <q>proper length</q> are also common terms, I prefer to avoid
      them due to <q>length</q> implying that the spacetime interval concerns <em>objects
       </em> rather than <em>events</em>).</p>
    <p>The quantity <i>s</i><sup>2</sup>, the spacetime interval, is independent of the
      frame of reference from which it is measured, and it is the
      <q>four-dimensional</q> distance between two events. It is calculated much the
      same as we have done it, albeit with the actual value of the speed of
      light. The right hand side of the equation may also be multiplied by -1.
      Since the left-hand side is a squared value, this does not fundamentally
      change the equation.</p>
    <blockquote class="equation"><i>s</i><sup>2</sup>= (<i>ct</i>)<sup>2</sup> - <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>z</i><sup>2</sup>
      <p><b>Equation ii-2.</b>  <span class="equation_description">Another typical form of the equation for the
        spacetime interval, with the right-hand side reversed in sign.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Spacetime intervals can also have a negative value. This depends on which
      of the two conventions above (Equation ii-1 or ii-2) is followed and on
      whether the events are separated more in space than they are in time. In
      the system we have been using (Equation ii-1), where positive intervals
      represent a distance in space, or proper distance; negative intervals
      represent a distance in time called the proper time. I&apos;ll explain what is
      meant by proper time after I provide an example. Let&apos;s say you count half
      a second between two events which are local to you, for instance your
      right rear turn signal blinking on and then off again.</p>
    <p>Using Equation ii-1, you calculate the spacetime interval between events:
   </p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>s</i><sup>2</sup>= 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> -(44*0.5)<sup>2</sup> = -484</p>
      <p><b>Equation ii-3.  
        </b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Your friend, approaching from behind, measures the time between the
      events to be longer by the Lorentz factor. He measures a delay of 0.58
      seconds. Since he is moving relative to your turn signal during this time,
      he also does not measure both events to happen in the same place in his
      reference frame (this is the same as the dropping ball problem in Chapter
      Five). He is further from your car when the light blinks on and nearer
      when it blinks off again. He measures a difference of 13 feet between the
      two events and calculates:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>s</i><sup>2</sup>= 13<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> -(44*0.58)<sup>2</sup> = -484</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In both cases, <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> is calculated as -484. The square root of
      this is the imaginary quantity 22<i>i </i>and (as above) is in units of
      feet. Dividing this by our fictitious speed of light (44 f.p.s.), we
      transform this into 0.5<i>i</i> and our units become seconds. Again, time
      is imaginary in a mathematical sense. This imaginary number 0.5<i>i</i>
      is the <q>imaginary distance,</q> or time, between the two events in a
      reference frame where they happen in the same place. So both you and your
      friend will agree that the local time or <q>proper time</q> between the two
      events, the time measured between the events in a reference frame where
      they are local, is a half-second. <q>Proper</q> time is so named not because it
      has good manners, but because it is <q>proprietary;</q> it is the time
      belonging to a reference frame and/or to an object having that reference
      frame.</p>
    <p>This bears repeating: if we use Equation ii-1 as our standard, then when
      <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> is positive and <i>s</i> is therefore real, it represents a
      proper distance. When <i>s</i> is imaginary, it represents a proper
      time. There is one final case to discuss, that in which <i>s</i> is zero.
      This happens when the space and time terms of the formula for the
      spacetime interval balance out. In this case, the Pythagorean sum <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>
      + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> , which is the square of spatial distance
      between two events, is equal to the term <i>(ct)<sup>2</sup></i> , which is the
      square of the distance traveled by any ray of light during the time
      between the two events. These two parts of the equation, being equal but
      opposite in sign, add to zero. If the spacetime interval between two
      events is zero, this means that a ray of light leaving the first event in
      the direction of the second event would intersect the second event; that
      is the light ray would arrive at the place of the second event at the
      exact same time as the second event. If we were to look at the night sky,
      there would be a spacetime interval between the event which we would
      measure as <q>here and now</q> and any events we see in the sky. This interval
      would be zero in all cases. We see the events we see now because their
      spatial, radial distance from us is exactly equal to the distance light
      travels between <q>now</q> and the time they occurred. The light we see from
      the moon is just over one second old. The moon is just over one
      light-second distant from the earth.</p>
    <p>Now let us relate the spacetime interval to the concept of the light cone
      diagram which we introduced in Chapter Seven. Our event is at the center.
      According to the convention we have followed so far in calculating the
      spacetime interval, events having a positive spacetime interval in
      relation to ours are <i>impresent, </i>or outside the cones. Events
      which define a negative interval in relation to our event are the<i> past
      </i>and<i> future</i>, inside one of the two cones. The events having a
      zero spacetime in relation to ours are the <i>present. </i>These events<i>
      </i>define the surface of the cones.<i> </i>They are the events we see
      right now (the lower cone) and the events from which other observers may
      see us as we are right now (the upper cone).</p>
    <p>It is worth restating the point that the sign (positive, negative, or
      zero) of the spacetime interval is reciprocal between events. That is, if
      the interval from A to B is positive (twenty-five, for instance), then the
      interval from B to A is also positive (also twenty-five). A is impresent
      to B and B is impresent to A. It is when we take the square root of the
      spacetime interval to get the proper distance between events that the
      relationships become complementary. A spacetime interval of twenty-five
      has roots of five and minus five. For example, event A is 5 units to the
      right of B; B is minus five units to the right (that is, five units to the
      left) of A.</p>
    <p>If the interval from A to B is negative (minus sixteen, for instance),
      then the interval from B to A is also negative (also minus sixteen). A is
      within one of the light cones of B and B is within one of the light cones
      of A. Again, it is when we take the square root of the spacetime interval
      to get the proper time between events that the relationships become
      complementary. A spacetime interval of minus twenty-five has roots of 4<i>i
      </i>and -4<i>i.</i> For example, event A is 4 seconds before B; B is four
      seconds after A. A is within B&apos;s past light cone, and B is within A&apos;s 
      future light cone.</p>
    <p>If the interval from A to B is zero, then the interval from B to A is
      also zero. A is on the boundary of one of the light cones of B and B is on
      the boundary of one of the light cones of A. Each is present to the other,
      but the distinction of which is future and which is past (or, similarly,
      which might be the cause and which the effect) is not found in the value
      of the interval. One of two cases is true, however: if light flashes occur
      at A and B, then either A&apos;s flash will be observable at B, or B&apos;s flash
      will be observable at A, if no obstacles lie in between.</p>
    <p>The time order of two events may be relative, but causality is not. <em>If</em>
      there is a frame of reference K in which two events A and B are
      simultaneous and separated by a positive distance on the x axis (this is
      an important <q>if</q>! There may not be such a frame of reference for a given
      pair of events), then there are many frames of reference K- and K+ in
      which the events occur one after the other and in either order. If K- is
      moving in the minus <i>x</i> direction relative to K, then A will
      precede B in K-. If K+ is moving in the positive x direction relative to
      K, B will precede A in K+. Though the time order is relative, no two
      observers would disagree about a relationship of causality between A and
      B. All will agree that A and B are far enough separated in space that one
      could not have caused the other. Causality cannot happen over a large
      distance and short time, where the distance <i>s</i> (in light-years,
      for instance) between the events is greater than the time <i>t</i> (in
      years). We call the interval between such events <dfn>spacelike</dfn>
      because they cannot be causally connected over time, in contrast to event
      pairs which have <dfn>timelike</dfn> separation.</p>
    <p>We have some intuitive sense of spacelike and timelike intervals. At a
      young age, we may be anxious for the school bell to signal the end of
      classes for the day or for Santa Claus to come; we understand that there&apos;s 
      nothing we can do to hasten either of those things, but we know we can be
      there when it happens. Those events are separated from us by a timelike
      interval. On the other hand, if we sleep through our morning alarm and
      wake up two minutes before the stock exchange opens, we know there is no
      chance of us being on the trading floor when the opening bell rings. That
      event has something similar to a spacelike separation from us; what would
      make it <em>actually</em> spacelike is if the stock exchange were so far
      away that we couldn&apos;t even radio a partner who is already on the floor to
      give him buy or sell instructions before trading starts in the next two
      minutes.</p>
    <p>These events having spacelike separations from us occupy what I called
      the <q>impresent</q> regions of the light cone diagram in Figure 7-13, the
      areas in neither the upper or lower cone.  And it can be argued that
      one can&apos;t speak of an unambiguous time order between those events and the
      one we occupy at the center of the diagram. Carlo Rovelli makes this
      argument very strongly in <cite>The Order of Time</cite>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>What is happening <q>now</q> in a distant place? Imagine, for example, that
        your sister has gone to Proxima b, the recently discovered planet that
        orbits a star at approximately four light years&apos; distance from us. What
        is your sister doing <em>now</em> on Proxima b?</p>
      <p>The only correct answer is that the question makes no sense. It is like
        asking <q>What is here, in Beijing?</q> when we are in Venice.
        <!-- p. 41--></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In Rovelli&apos;s example, there is nothing that we or our sister can do now
      that can have any effect on the other&apos;s life for years to come. Even
      between places on earth, the same basic condition exists; the difference
      is one of degree, not of principle. The delay may only be a few millionths
      of a second if we are speaking to our sister on the phone, but it is
      there. If we want to see each other in person, the delay is of course
      longer. This is the idea behind the thought experiment that appeared in
      this book&apos;s introduction and gives this book its title. Even when noon
      comes how long would it be until Ford can see for himself that his cat is
      in fact dead? How long would it be until he could even receive word on the
      matter from his family or household staff?</p>
    <p>Going to the admittedly more confusing example in <q>Fit the Fifth</q>,
      how can anyone at the Non Sequitur in Terschelling, Netherlands know
      whether or not Hamlet&apos;s love interest Ophelia is still alive in Helsingør,
      Denmark? How long would it take for word of her death to arrive on
      horseback? How long by carrier pigeon? By radio or cellular phone? How
      precisely meaningful is it to say that it is a particular time somewhere
      else, particularly when there might be two different frames of reference
      in which a pair of events &mdash; one at one place and one at the other &mdash; may be
      measured to occur in opposite time order? This ambiguity, I now confess,
      motivated much of the exaggerated nonsense we witnessed (and will return
      to) at the Non Sequitur.</p>
    <p>What modern science has come to think of as a <em>four</em>-dimensional
      spacetime was not Einstein&apos;s idea as such. In fact, the idea of any
      unified <q>spacetime</q> was not explicit in the 1905 publication of Einstein&apos;s 
      paper on special relativity; it was conceived later by Einstein&apos;s former
      math professor, Hermann Minkowski  (<q><i>ming-<strong>koff</strong>-skee</i></q>),
      who created a four-dimensional geometry as a context for special
      relativity in 1908 and announced it thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung
        from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength.
        They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are
        doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the
        two will preserve an independent reality.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It would take another four years for Einstein to warm up to Minkowski&apos;s 
      reinterpretation of his work.  <q>Since the mathematicians have invaded the theory of relativity, I do not understand it myself any more,</q> he once
      complained, but Minkowski&apos;s concept nevertheless soon became a cornerstone
      of Einstein&apos;s efforts to formulate general relativity.</p>
    <p><a name="ThreeShaltThouCount-b"><!--#ThreeShaltThouCount--></a>While the
      math undeniably produces valid results, we must be cautious in how we
      think of time as a dimension of any sort, let alone as a fourth one
      related to the familiar three. Our relative speed <i>w</i> through the
      imaginary dimension of time might be thought of as a constant <i>c</i>
      not just in one, but presumably in <i>any </i>direction, and thus in all
      three dimensions of space; all of our parts wiggle every which way. We
      also might say that any fixed time such as 1:00 approaches us from <em>all</em> 
      directions at the speed of light, and then flees with that same
      speed in all directions once that time has passed. That&apos;s an unusual thing
      to say, but what I mean is that the light from the events which we will
      see at 1:00 defines what is our <q>present</q> at 1:00. This light comes toward
      us from all directions at the speed of light, reaching us at that exact
      time. Thereafter, the light from our 1:00 event scatters in all directions
      at <i>c</i>. We can&apos;t see it anymore because it&apos;s not here anymore. After
      it passes, 1:00 gets further and further away from us at the speed of
      light. In this respect, we experience time <em>radially</em> rather than
      linearly. In another sense, our speed<i> w</i> through the imaginary
      dimension of time is always <i>c</i> in our own frame of reference, and
      might be supposed to correspond to our <em>angular</em> and <em>oscillatory</em> 
      motion(s) through space, as represented by the motion of light in a
      light clock. We measure ourselves to have a <em>linear</em> spatial
      velocity <i>v </i>of zero in our frame of reference. In our triangular
      diagram (Figure 21-6), <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>w</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>, or 0<sup>2</sup> + <i>w</i><sup>2</sup>
      = <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p>This is why I am often uncomfortable with the use of the term
      <q>four-dimensional</q> when referring to spacetime. Space has only three
      dimensions and time is always measured in these three dimensions. If I add
      <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>z</i><sup>2</sup> to determine that some star is
      three light years away from me radially, I know that the light I see from
      it now is three years old. The difference in time is the difference in
      space. This three-dimensional space-time equivalence might be apparent in
      the terms for the spacetime interval if we ask why time, which is
      imaginary as a distance, is subtracted, whereas the <q>real</q> dimensions of
      space are added. The calculation used to suggest to me that:  <q>If you
      measured more time between the events than I did, you must have measured
      more space too, because space and time are the same. Subtract the time
      measurement so you don&apos;t double-count anything.</q> But this isn&apos;t quite it.
      The other formulation of the spacetime interval (Equation ii-2), in which
      the signs are reversed to make time and proper time <q>real</q> and space and
      proper distance <q>imaginary,</q> is equally valid. Now I see that the math
      simply reflects the fact that relativistic length contraction goes hand-in
      hand with the slowing of clocks, and that if some pair of events are
      measured further apart in space by one observer than by another, they will
      also be measured to have greater separation in time. Rather than calling
      either space or time <q>imaginary,</q> we should instead consider the 
      <em>distinction</em> between them imaginary.</p>
    <p>This imaginary factor is a point which Einstein may have failed to
      emphasize adequately in his explanation of relativity. Einstein described
      Minkowski&apos;s idea of a four-dimensional <q>spacetime</q> without satisfactorily
      addressing the fact that this <q>fourth dimension</q> is mathematically <i>imaginary</i>
      in its relation to the other three, and thus makes the proposed
      four-dimensional space ontologically invalid, though mathematically sound.
      When pointing out that the term <i>ct<sup>2</sup></i> is <i>subtracted</i> (rather
      than added) in the semi-Pythagorean sum for the spacetime interval
      (Equation ii-1), Einstein wrote of this exception as being a matter of
      giving time <q>due prominence</q> among its three spatial peers &mdash; rather than
      it setting time apart as something entirely different and in some sense
      redundant.</p>
    <p>While instructionally useful, the idea of a <q>four-dimensional world</q> is
      misleading, in that one might assume that a fourth dimension would be at
      right angles to the other three and that all of history exists in
      progressively greater distances along a <q>time axis.</q> This model is
      suggested by the light cone diagrams we used in Chapter Two. This is also
      what H. G. Wells had suggested in his 1895 novel <i>The Time Machine.</i> 
      The Time Traveler in Wells&apos; novel reasons that if time is a dimension, he
      should be able to move in it as he is able to move through the three
      dimensions of space. He builds a machine which allows him to do this,
      visits the far-distant future, and then returns to his own time. Many
      time-travel stories have been written, because the idea of time as a
      fourth dimension makes entertaining fiction; but it may be a poor
      foundation for learning real science. In <a href="#ThreeShaltThouCount-a">Chapter
        Twenty</a>, I discussed some reasons we might choose to see time as
      being simply a different way that we experience the familiar three
      dimensions of space.</p>
    <p>Einstein wrote of the Lorentz transformations as <q>correspond[ing] to a
      <q>rotation</q> of the coordinate system
       in the four-dimensional <q>world.</q></q>
      Science writers since Einstein&apos;s time have made the mistake of asserting
      that time can <q>rotate</q> into space and vice versa, as if we can diminish
      one by increasing the other. This is simply not so, as time and space
      measurements are each contravariant with regard to changes in the basis
      vectors, and these bases are covariant with each other in magnitude. Put
      more simply, time and space increase or decrease <em>together</em>. The
      sense in which Einstein used the word <q>rotation</q> is not the one with which
      we are familiar.  We will see all of this illustrated in Chapter
      Twenty-One.</p>
    <p>All these criticisms notwithstanding, Minkowski did give us both the
      spacetime interval and a very useful system of diagramming coordinates in
      two different frames of reference. Not only do they allow us to compare
      measurements between coordinate systems, but they show time as not
      necessarily orthogonal (at right angles) to space, which we might take as
      a hint that there is a dependency of some kind between the three
      dimensions of space and what it is that we measure as <q>time.</q></p>
    <h4>Minkowski diagrams</h4>
    <p>Let&apos;s look at Minkowski diagrams and see how they work. In Figure ii-1,
      we have a Minkowski diagram which uses the familiar image of a light cone,
      the grey area bounded by a black background. Points A, B, and C are three
      events separated in space and simultaneous in our frame of reference, the
      frame considered to be <q>at rest,</q> with velocity <i>v</i>=0. There are
      multiple other frames of reference represented in this animated
      illustration, with velocities relative to ours ranging from half the speed
      of light in the direction to our left (in the negative <i>x</i>
      direction) to three-tenths of the speed of light, going in the opposite
      direction to our right.  As the illustration changes to represent
      these various relative velocities, the green grid lines are compressed and
      stretched along a diagonal direction between opposite corners of the
      diagram such that lines representing constant position or simultaneous
      times in that other frame of reference become diagonal as well. The x axis
      is a line of constant time corresponding to the time <i>t</i>=0. For
      us, the <i>x</i> axis crosses through all three events A, B, and C, and
      all three thus have the same zero time coordinate. In the other frames of
      reference, though, the <i>x</i> axis is tilted such that events A and C
      are on opposite sides of it; accordingly, in these frames of reference,
      one of the events A or C is measured to be in the relative future, and one
      in the relative past.</p>

    <p>It may cause you great consternation to be told that these events could
      in some sense be reversed in time order, but it&apos;s really okay that these
      events have no absolute sequentiality, because they are far enough away
      from each other that there is no potential for causation between them in
      any frame of reference. None of the three events lies inside a light cone
      of another. We aren&apos;t likely to notice ambiguities of this type in the
      everyday world because the speed of light is so fast. A difference of one
      second is the difference between here and the moon. Remember that a
      typical light cone might be considered to have exaggerated scale; in the
      units of measurement we are familiar with, the sides of the light cone
      would have a much shallower slope, leaving relatively little area in the
      diagram where time order does not matter (Figure 7-16).</p>
    <p>So the next time you&apos;re reading a book about quantum weirdness that
      describes <q>Alice</q> performing measurements that instantaneously change the
      results of her lab partner <q>Bob</q> who is making measurements far away,
      remember that it&apos;s a logical fallacy. These events cannot be said to have
      a strict relative time order. They have meaningful time <em>coordinates</em>
      in some frame of reference, but no meaningful <em>concurrence</em> or <em>sequentiality</em>. 
      We will return to this fallacy in Chapter Thirty-Two.</p>
    <p>
      Some aspects of an animation can be hard to appreciate since everything is
      always moving, so let&apos;s look at some still diagrams of <q>Minkowski spacetime</q>
      and see how they can be constructed. Later in this chapter you will also
      find a link to an interactive diagram.

    <p>In one frame of reference, which we will call K, events occurring at
      various times <i>t</i> along an <i>x</i> axis can be mapped on a
      two-dimensional <i>x-t</i> coordinate system.</p>

    <p>Events in the frame K&prime;, which is in uniform motion relative to K along a
      common <i>x</i> axis, can also be mapped on this grid if allowances are
      made. First, we will stipulate that both frames measure time relative to
      the event at which their origins crossed; that is, the event (<i>x,t</i>)
      = (0,0) is common to both frames. Secondly, we will continue to measure
      space and time in units such that <i>c</i>=1. Let&apos;s draw a light ray
      leaving the origin O, or the event (<i>x,t</i>)=(0,0), and then
      calibrate the scale.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Above, we have arbitrarily chosen the event P as the event which is
      reached by the light ray after one unit of time (<i>t</i>=1) in the
      frame of reference K. The construction of the <i>x</i>&prime; and <i>t</i>&prime;
      axes, which are the measures taken in the reference frame K&prime;, is as
      follows: Between K and K&prime; an angle <i>&phi;</i> is defined such that the
      tangent of <i>&phi;</i> is equal to the relative velocity <i>v/c</i>
      between the two frames (tan <i>&phi;</i> = <i>v/c</i>; <i>&phi;</i> =
      tan<sup>-1</sup> <i>v/c</i>). This is not the angle <i>&theta;</i> which
      appears in the light clock diagram; it has no significance in physical
      space. It is the angle associated with the <q>worldline,</q> the path of the
      origin, of K&prime; in the reference frame K; specifically, it is the
      angle  between the <i>t</i> axis belonging to K and the <i>t&prime;</i>
      axis belonging to K&prime;.</p>

        the worldline of the origin of K&prime; through the reference frame K.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the Minkowski space-time diagram, the <i>x</i>&prime; and <i>t</i>&prime;
      axes form the angle <i>&phi; </i>with the <i>x</i> and <i>t</i> axes
      respectively so that they form an angle less than a right angle to each
      other (Figure ii-4).  If we were to mix measurements between K and
      K&prime;, using the time coordinates of one and the space coordinates of the
      other, the angle between the two axes <i>t&prime;</i> and <i>x</i> (for
      instance) would give us an affine coordinate system much like the one seen
      in Figure 17-32, and a metric similar to the one in Figures 17-33 and
      17-35 (depending on whether we use the angle between the two mixed basis
      vectors  <i>t&prime;</i> and <i>x</i>, or the angle between the <i>x</i>
      and <i>x&prime;</i> axes): all four elements would be nonzero.</p>
    <p>We might think that the metric of K&prime; is likewise dependent on the angle
      between <i>x&prime;</i> and <i>t&prime;</i> as seen in Figure ii-5, but<em>
        in their own frames of reference</em>, the metrics of K and K&prime; are the
      same.  We&apos;ll show what those metrics look like a little later on.</p>
    <p>Now it&apos;s time to look at the coordinate grid in K&prime;. The <i>x</i>&prime; grid
      lines run parallel to the <i>t</i>&prime; axis and the <i>t</i>&prime; grid lines
      run parallel to the <i>x</i>&prime; axis:</p>

    <h4>Four-displacement vectors</h4>
    <p>
      What sort of vectors will we find in this four-dimensional representation of
      spacetime? We call them four-vectors, and we have already talked about them
      without calling them such. A four-vector is just a vector with four
      components, three being related to space and the fourth to time. Like all
      vectors, it has components that change based on the frame of reference or <em>basis
      </em> it is being measured in. We started off in Chapter Eight with vectors
      having two space components, then saw vectors with three space components in
      Chapter Twelve. In Chapter Nineteen we reinterpreted the Galilean
      transformations from Chapter Six as being a matter of vectors having one
      time and one space component. In the Galilean system, the time component was
      agreed on by all observers regardless of their velocity. Now we are becoming
      familiar with a quantity called the spacetime interval, which is invariant
      between all frames of reference; we will consider that interval as a <em>
        vector</em> having components in three directions of space and one
      direction of time. Observers in various reference frames may measure the
      components of this vector differently, but as a physical reality it is
      invariant.
    </p>
    <p>We&apos;re going to dive a little deep into the math now, but just for a few
      paragraphs. Even if you don&apos;t follow all the math and the abstract
      thinking, you may find some of it intriguing, as we are going to use it to
      better understand the precise relationship of time to space.</p>
    <p>There is more than one way to treat the spacetime interval as a vector,
      and one of them has fallen out of favor among scientists. The first
      standard, abandoned very early on, was to call the space components <i>x</i>,
      <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>, and the time component <i>ict</i>; to
      calculate the magnitude of this vector, we compute its dot product with
      itself to get |<b>s</b> |<sup>2</sup>. We covered this earlier in
      Equation 19-8 : <b>s</b> <sup>T</sup><b>s</b>  = |<b>s</b> |<sup>2</sup>.
      When we wish to make the metric tensor explicit, we write: <b>|s|</b> <sup>2</sup>
      = <b>s</b> <sup>T</sup>G<b>s</b> , as in Equation
      19-15.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/mpII-1.png" style="max-height: 120px;"></p>
      <p><b>Equation ii-4</b>.  <span class="equation_description">The magnitude of the spacetime interval
        <b>s</b>  in terms of components <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>,
        and <i>ict</i>. <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> = <b>s</b> <sup>T</sup><i>I</i><b>s</b></span> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This all comes out the same as in Equation ii-1; it&apos;s just new notation.
      In this formulation of the spacetime interval as a vector, the metric of
      spacetime is simply <i>I</i>, the identity matrix associated with flat
      space and orthogonal coordinate axes. There&apos;s nothing strange about the
      big <i>I</i>.<!--Honest, I never wrote this with GEB in mind, which spends hundreds of pages examining the strangeness of the identity, <q>I</q>-->
      It&apos;s the <em>little i</em>, the imaginary number in our time component,
      which remains the weird part that demands explanation. It&apos;s like a
      dangling thread on a knit sweater that just dares us to pull on it, and
      pull on it we shall. We have already given the <i>i</i> a <em>philosophical
       </em> significance by proposing that it means that the distinction
      between time and space is imaginary; but let&apos;s try to exhaust the ways we
      can explore its significance <em>mathematically</em>.</p>
    <p>I propose to name the convention shown in Equation ii-4 after Henri
      Poincar&eacute;, who conceived this kind of four-dimensional spacetime in the
      time between Einstein&apos;s 1905 paper and Minkowski&apos;s 1908 announcement of a
      different formulation. When later in this book I refer to a <q>Poincar&eacute; metric</q> or Poincar&eacute; standard of spacetime, this will be what I mean.</p>
    <p>If we don&apos;t like the <i>i</i> just dangling there in Equation ii-4, we
      could invent a metric that hides if for us; we could call the time
      component <i>ct</i> instead of <i>ict</i> (Equation ii-1), and
      write that |<b>s</b> |<sup>2</sup> is <b>s</b> <sup>T</sup>
      times <i>M</i> times <b>s</b>  where <i>M</i> is the
      spacetime metric that masks the imaginary <i>i</i> for us by replacing
      it with its real-valued square. We call this metric the Minkowski metric.</p>

        where <i>M</i> is a peculiar spacetime metric.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What we have done here is simply a change of basis. Components and basis
      vectors are contravariant, so if we divide the <i>i</i> from the last
      component, we multiply it into its corresponding basis vector. In Equation
      ii-5, the <i>i</i> has been scratched out from the time component and
      has been moved to the matching basis vector, where it shows up in the
      metric tensor; the metric tensor contains the dot products of the basis
      vectors, and the <i>i</i> has been squared in the process of
      multiplying the new time basis vector with itself, so for this reason the
      <i>i</i> re-emerges here as a factor of minus one (circled). One benefit
      of this basis is that it puts all four components of the vector in the
      same units of measure.</p>
    <p>But something is still fishy here. In this system, the dot product of the
      <i>ct</i> basis vector <em>with itself</em> is minus one. Now it&apos;s the
      metric tensor that looks freaky. Maybe the Minkowski metric should scare
      you at least a little bit because it hides the <i>i</i>. Minkowski
      himself didn&apos;t do that when he first presented his spacetime geometry.
      Disguising the <i>i</i> with this metric seems to me like papering over
      a very fundamental and important truth that relativity implies, namely
      that the distinction between time and space is imaginary. Maybe you don&apos;t
      think that doing so is any more or less strange than having an <i>i</i>
      in the vector components, because you <q>get</q> that this metric is not in any
      sense normal. Bernhard Riemann would have asked <i>Was machen Sie denn
        da?</i> <q>What do you think you are doing there? My metric tensor should never produce distances which are a negative square.</q> (For this reason,
      strictly speaking, the Minkowski metric is not a metric tensor, but a
      member of a more general class of mathematical objects called <dfn>bilinear
        forms</dfn>.) But this convention of using <i>ct</i> as the time
      component has been the standard for most of the history of relativity, and
      as a result we get intervals having a square which is negative (Equation
      ii-3).</p>
    <p>There are many other conventions for spacetime vectors. Most commonly,
      the time coefficient goes before the space components. And we have seen
      that you can reverse the signs of the squares of all the time and space
      components (Equation ii-2); this would mean that the signs in the metric
      tensor would flip as well. Some conventions use numerical indices rather
      than letters; some of those range from 0 to 3 and others from 1 to 4. But
      most of these variations, the <i>i</i> does not appear directly; it
      lurks in the matrix, waiting to be fully explained.</p>
    <p>When the idea of magnitude in a vector space was generalized to the
      complex plane, the problem of finding a product of an imaginary number
      with itself was put in different terms. Rather than doing what we have
      done in Equations ii-4 and ii-5, inserting a metric between the two copies
      of the number to make it all work out, someone decided to just go ahead
      and say that the problem was solved by multiplying the number not with
      itself but with a sort of <q>mirror image</q> of it that lived in a related but
      separate space, a <q>dual space.</q> As we saw in Chapter <i>i</i>, the
      squared magnitude of a complex number, what we call the <q>inner product</q> of
      a complex number with itself, is not the square of that complex number. It
      is the complex number times <em>something else</em>, called its complex
      conjugate, which is the reflection of that complex number across the real
      axis in the complex plane, its counterpart in the dual space. The number <i>x</i>+<i>iy</i>
      gets multiplied by its conjugate <i>x</i>-<i>iy</i>.</p>
    <p>There&apos;s no obvious reason that something similar couldn&apos;t have been done
      for spacetime. I&apos;m going to have the variable <i>x</i> momentarily
      stand for all three dimensions of space together for clarity&apos;s sake; in
      this paragraph and the next two or so, let it be understood that <i>x</i>
      implies √(<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>z</i><sup>2</sup>). With that context, I
      wish to point out that someone could have decided that the interval <i>s</i><sup>2</sup>
      wasn&apos;t computed in terms of <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> minus (<i>ct</i>)<sup>2</sup>.
      It could just as well have been put in terms of multiplying the quantity <i>x</i>+<i>ct</i>
      times a <q>conjugate</q> or
       <q>dual</q> quantity <i>x</i>-<i>ct</i>. And just
      to keep time and space on their proper footing, I should acknowledge that
      the same is true of multiplying the quantity <i>ct+x</i> times the
      quantity <i>ct-x</i>, when the interval has been defined that way, with
      opposite signs. The interval would then be seen as <em>two</em> complementary
      numbers which are multiplied together to evaluate the magnitude of the
      interval each represents, rather than being seen as the same thing
      multiplied by itself with a matrix in between.</p>
    <p>This duality has really been there for us to see all along. Being a
      square, the quantity <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> which defines the interval
      always contains two solutions for <i>s</i>, one positive and one
      negative. What we are seeing here is a certain ambiguity in the direction
      of time in the first case (<i>x</i>+<i>ct</i> times <i>x</i>-<i>ct</i>)
      and in the direction of space in the second case (<i>ct+x</i> times <i>ct-x</i>),
      and this simply arises from the way we calculate the length of a vector.
      This method goes all the way back to Pythagoras: when we square a
      quantity, we discard any information we had about its sign, positive or
      negative. The square holds what we need to know about the length, but
      contains no information about a direction. In this ambiguity of direction,
      we might also see a reflection of the way light connects the same two
      points in space in opposite directions of time and space. I see the moon
      as it was a second ago, and what I am doing now can be seen on the moon a
      second from now.</p>
    <p>As for the question of whether to subtract (<i>ct</i>)<sup>2</sup>
      from <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> or to subtract <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>
      from (<i>ct</i>)<sup>2</sup> when calculating the interval, it seems
      reasonable to follow the example of Hero (Chapter <i>i</i>) and choose
      the order that gives you a positive number to take the square root of.
      Some event pairs have spacelike separation, and some timelike, and never
      shall the two be confused; the order of subtraction that will make <i>i
     </i> unnecessary should tell you whether the interval you are calculating
      is timelike or spacelike.</p>
    <p>Going back to the complex number analogy, choosing the most convenient
      convention of signs would be to reflect the number <i>x+ct</i> across
      the <em>nearest</em> axis, since both axes would in this case be real,
      to get either <i>x-ct</i> or <i>ct-x</i> as appropriate, and then to
      multiply the two together. By choosing the nearest axis, you would avoid
      crossing the asymptotes of the hyperbolas defined by the two equations <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>
      - (<i>ct</i>)<sup>2</sup>  =1 and (<i>ct</i>)<sup>2</sup> - <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>
      =1. Those asymptotes, <i>x=ct</i> and <i>x=-ct</i>, are the equations
      of lightlike intervals. After this alternate way of looking at the
      interval hit me like an apple falling on my head, it wasn&apos;t too long
      before I saw that this idea I was developing looked a lot like what
      mathematicians call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-complex_number"
        title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-complex_number" target="_blank"><dfn>split-complex
          numbers</dfn></a>, and that these are indeed seen as a good fit for
      Minkowski space. It&apos;s good to know I&apos;m not completely mistaken in this
      approach.</p>
    <p>I realize that all of this is terribly abstract, but one of my aims here
      is to show that the mathematical formalisms we use to represent physical
      reality are subject to change and ought not to be confused with the
      reality itself. I also hope this digression might inspire you to take a
      closer look at some similarities between some things that aren&apos;t often
      juxtaposed and to consider how and why they are similar and how and why
      they are different.</p>
    <p>In Figure ii-9 I hope I can make my meaning in the previous paragraph
      more clear. You can see a gap in the center where the hyperbolas do not
      meet, but that is simply a matter of scale and of having arbitrarily
      chosen an <q>interval</q> of one on the right-hand side of both hyperbola
      equations. Either of these equations, when scaled a certain way, will make
      a shape very much like a light cone.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>I can&apos;t say what there is of lasting value in the split-complex number
      paradigm for the calculation of the spacetime interval, but I find some
      useful insights in it. For one, it reminds us of the significance of the
      hyperbola. In the next chapter, we&apos;ll return to the conic sections and see
      their application in relativity, and we will also return to Figure ii-9.</p>
    <h4>Four-velocity vectors</h4>
    <p>The spacetime interval is a four-<em>displacement</em> vector, dealing with
    relative positions; velocities can be represented as four-vectors as well,
    accounting for both time and space. Given the foundation of relativity, we
    should hardly be surprised to learn that the invariant quantity in this case
    will be the speed of light. But still, what exactly does the speed of light
    have to do with each and every possible velocity in spacetime? In previous
    chapters, I have suggested that relativity is more easily understood if we
    consider everything as behaving in essentially the same manner as a light
    clock; that it all moves at the speed of light at all times, even if it is
    just bouncing back and forth over a short distance. The motion that we can&apos;t
    see macroscopically is considered movement <q>through time,</q> which allows
    changes to proceed. This is not a viewpoint you will often read, but all
    physics textbooks nevertheless represent the velocity four-vector as having
    an invariant magnitude equal to the speed of light; only its direction
    changes in a change of reference frame or after its corresponding object is
    accelerated, not its magnitude.</p>
    
    <blockquote>

     </p>
      <p><b>Figure 20-6</b>  (repeated).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Four-velocity vectors have the three familiar space components from
      classical physics, but to keep everything invariant, the sum of the
      velocities through space is accompanied by a fourth component which is a
      velocity <q>through time.</q> This four-vector is similar in many ways similar
      to what we saw in Figure 20-6, with the sum of the space velocities at
      right angles to the speed of the clock and summing up to the speed of
      light in a Euclidean fashion; but standard physics texts tend to disguise
      this rather simple relationship behind the formalism of Minkowski
      spacetime. Let&apos;s look at the difference between the two approaches.</p>
    <p>First of all, let&apos;s label each of the space components of the
      four-velocity in question as <b>i</b> , <b>j</b> , and
      <b>k</b> , and say that their vector sum is <b>v</b>.
      The components <b>i</b> , <b>j</b> , and <b>k</b> 
      could be the x-y-z coordinates in a Cartesian system, or they could be
      three polar coordinates; it really doesn&apos;t matter as long as they allow us
      to fully describe the direction and magnitude of the velocity in 3D space.
      What Figure 20-6 is telling us is that there could be a fourth component,
      <b>w</b>, which adds with the other three to always make a
      constant vector sum of c. This vector <b>w</b> is proportional
      to the <q>speed</q> of a clock which is moving with velocity <b>v</b>,
      and by no coincidence would also be the speed through space of the beams
      in any light clocks having this same velocity. If you&apos;re willing to go out
      on a limb with me, you might imagine <b>w</b> as the
      microscopic, possibly subatomic oscillating speed of all the parts of any
      physical object moving with velocity <b>v</b>, but that is
      entirely unnecessary if it doesn&apos;t help you get a better grip on the math.
      The magnitude of <b>w</b> is <i>c</i> divided by the
      Lorentz factor, <i>&gamma;</i>. Let&apos;s call all four components together
      the four-velocity <b>U</b>  (<i>i, j, k, c</i>/<i>&gamma;</i>),
      and show how the magnitude of this vector would be computed.</p>
    <p>In Equations ii-4 and ii-5, we saw how the magnitude of a
      four-displacement vector was computed both in algebraic notation and in
      matrix multiplication notation. I&apos;d like to do the same again here.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/mpii-3.png" style="max-height: 170px;">

        Euclidean (and fully Riemannian) space specified by the Poincar&eacute;  metric

    </blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <p>Notice that the <q>metric</q> of this vector space is simply the identity
      matrix. I have only included it here so that it can stand in contrast to
      the more common way of representing four-velocity vectors. What you will
      see in textbooks is a rather different four-velocity vector <b>U</b>  with
      components (<i>&gamma;</i><i>i,</i> <i><i>&gamma;</i>j,</i> <i><i>&gamma;</i>k,
     </i> <i></i>&gamma;c</i>), which correspond to a much different vector space
      having the Minkowski metric:</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>At the bottoms of Figures ii-10 and ii-11 I have done some algebra to
      show that these two systems are mathematically equivalent. Again, the
      mathematical formalisms we use to represent physical reality are subject
      to change and ought not to be confused with the reality itself.</p>

      Slicing the Cone (II) </h3>
    <p>The conic sections we reviewed in Chapter Thirteen and saw in Chapter
      Sixteen as manifestations of gravity are also very useful in describing
      relativity. It is surprising to me that these representations are not used
      more commonly.</p>
    <h4>The ellipse</h4>
    <p>In Chapter Seven, I introduced light cone diagrams as an imaginary
      geometry in which time as measured by a particular observer is arranged
      perpendicularly to that observer&apos;s space. We used Figure 7-14 to imagine
      that each horizontal slice of a light cone represents a set of events that
      are simultaneous to that observer; in that example, we imagined the set of
      events that a spherical pulse of light would occupy as it expanded outward
      over time, and each slice of the cone represented a particular time.</p>
    <p>But as we saw in Chapter Thirteen, we can slice a cone in different ways;
      if we tilt the plane we use to slice the cone, we get an ellipse. And due
      to some interesting circumstances, we can slice light cones in various
      ways to show how different sets of events are simultaneous for different
      observers. The circular slices are simultaneous for the observers (and for
      the frame of reference) to whom (and to which) the light cones belong; for
      other observers or reference frames in relative motion to the former ones,
      sets of simultaneous events are defined by ellipses.</p>

    <p>If we wish to relate Figure 21-1 to the Minkowski diagrams at the end of
      the previous chapter, then the center line would be the <i>t</i> axis,
      and the <i>x</i> axis would be perpendicular to it; we would draw the <i>t</i>&prime;
      axis through the dots at the center of the ellipses, and the <i>x</i>&prime;
      axis in any of the planes which intersect the cone for each value of <i>t</i>&prime;.</p>
    <p>It&apos;s worth taking a look at the idea of the ellipse itself to get some
      sense of why it is a natural fit for special relativity.  The ellipse
      could be considered an extension of the circle, or a general category of
      which the circle is a special case. What I mean by this is we might
      consider a circle to be an ellipse having both of its foci in the same
      place, the distance between them being zero. There is a mathematical
      relationship between the separation of the foci and the relative lengths
      of the two aspects of the ellipse. Let&apos;s call <i>a</i> the distance
      from the center of the ellipse to one of its two furthest points from the
      center, <i>b</i> the distance from the center to one of the nearest
      points, and <i>c</i> the distance from the center to one of the two
      foci (Figure 21-2). If we know the lengths <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, we
      can calculate <i>c</i> using the relation <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>=
      <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>. If <i>a</i> is 5 and
      <i>b</i> is 3, then <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> is 16. The two values of c
      would then be plus and minus four, which in this case means four units of
      distance to either side of the center.</p>

      it too long, it seems to enjoy looking back at you too).</p>

    <p>And now I would like to tie all this geometry into the concept of the
      light clock. Suppose that instead of a pair of flat mirrors between which
      a pulse of light was endlessly reflected, we had a spherical mirror,
      polished to perfection on its inside surface. If we were able to create a
      pulse of light at the center which went in all directions, the light would
      be reflected back to that center. If we were somehow able to get ourselves
      out of the way of that process in time, then the reflected light would
      continue through the center and expand outward again in a never-ending
      cycle. I am not saying that such a spherical light clock could be
      engineered for practical use of any sort; I just want you to consider the
      physics and geometry of it, because of what we are going to ask next.</p>
    <p>What happens if we set this clock in motion or, equivalently, consider it
      from a moving frame of reference? In that case, the center of the sphere
      will not be in the same place by the time the light comes back to it after
      one cycle or <q>tick</q> of the clock.  How does all of that reflection
      work out in the new frame of reference?</p>
    <p>Once again, the ellipse serves an important role. In Figure 21-4 we see a
      pool of liquid contained by an elliptical boundary which reflects any
      waves on the pool&apos;s surface. If the surface is still and waves are then
      created by dropping liquid onto the surface at one focus, they will be
      reflected and then converge at the other.</p>

    <p>Does the surface of the sphere take this shape when it is on motion,
      being contracted in the direction of motion as per the requirements of
      special relativity so that the waves go back and forth between foci? Well,
      yes and no. First of all, if we suppose that the direction of motion is
      horizontal so that one focus is to the right of the other, as in Figure
      21-4, then the sphere will contract in that direction so that it is <em>shorter
       </em> left-to right than it is top-to-bottom, which is not what we see in
      Figure 21-4. But hold on, we will see it all work out anyway, because in
      addition to length contraction, we have the effect of time dilation and
      non-simultaneity. While the sphere as an <em>object</em> is not
      simultaneously in the shape of Figure 21-4, the <em>events</em> at which
      the light reflects from the sphere during one cycle <em>do</em> have
      this shape in our frame of reference.</p>

        One tick of a spherical light clock in motion at over half the speed of
        light.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In Figure 21-6 we have an animation of how all of these considerations
      play out. It&apos;s very <q>busy</q> visually and warrants repeated viewing,
      focusing on the relationships of different processes each time. Here is a
      list of the various shapes in it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In black, we have the spherical light clock, contracted in the
        direction of its motion into an ellipse. It moves but does not change
        size.</li>
      <li>In red, after time zero, we see a circle that expands outward from the
        leftmost focus of the green ellipse. It changes size but remains
        centered on this focus. It appears when the black ellipse centers on
        this focus, and represents the light-going-outward phases of one <q>tick</q>
        of the clock. Those portions of the red circle which are outside the
        black elliptical boundary of the clock should be considered imaginary,
        with the portions inside being real.</li>
      <li>In blue, after time zero, we see a circle that contracts inward toward
        the rightmost focus of the green ellipse. It changes size but remains
        centered on this focus. It represents the light-going-inward phases of
        one <q>tick</q> of the clock. Those portions of the blue circle which are
        outside the black elliptical boundary of the clock should be considered
        imaginary, with the portions inside being real.</li>
      <li>In green is an ellipse formed by the intersections of the red and blue
        circles over time, which events also intersect with the black elliptical
        boundary of the clock. This green ellipse is the location in our
        reference frame of all of the events where the light is reflected from
        the clock&apos;s interior surface during one <q>tick.</q></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Relating all of this back to Figure 21-1, suppose that this figure
      represents a duration of one tick of the spherical clock in the clock&apos;s 
      own frame of reference, starting just after the light is reflected back
      inward from all points on the surface, continuing through the time when
      the light again reaches the center until it reaches the mirrored surface
      again. The width of the light cones at each vertical height of the diagram
      represents the radial distance of the light from the clock&apos;s center at
      some time in its frame of reference. Each end of the diagram represents a
      simultaneous <q>snapshot</q> of where the light is at its widest propagation at
      that point in the clock&apos;s cycle. Each point on the mirrored surface at
      this time is considered an individual <em>event</em>, and in the clock&apos;s 
      reference frame, these events are simultaneous. But in any reference frame
      in relative motion, these events will be neither simultaneous nor
      spherically-shaped in space. They will form an ellipsoid in space and be
      spread out in both space and time, as we see in Figure 21-6, where they
      form the green ellipse. Similarly, the events forming the shape of the
      clock itself, if considered as an instantaneous snapshot from a frame of
      reference moving relative to it, are measured as being non-simultaneous in
      the clock&apos;s own reference frame; and this set of events which had an
      ellipsoid shape in the other frame of reference is spherical in the
      clock&apos;s own.  To get the shape of the black ellipse or the green
      ellipse from the spherical mirror, we either multiply or divide its
      horizontal length by the same Lorentz factor. These two operations of
      multiplication and division are thus perfectly balanced, like the inverse
      transformation matrices in Figure 19-22.  For a fascinating in-depth
      discussion of the symmetries involved in changes of reference frame, I
      highly recommend the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJHszsWbB6hqlw73QjgZcFh4DrkQLSCQa"

    <h4> The hyperbola</h4>
    <p>If you want to understand relativity well, you absolutely need to be
      acquainted with the hyperbola. If you haven&apos;t done so yet, go to the <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/fmRARmem"

        target="_blank">geogebra page</a> shown in Figure ii-8 and play with the
      velocity slider at the top of the Minkowski diagram. Notice that because
      of the way the red grid changes scale, the intersection points of this
      grid move along a hyperbolic curve as you adjust the velocity.</p>
    <p>As mentioned in Chapter <i>i</i><sup>2</sup>, the formula for the
      spacetime interval describes a hyperbolic relationship between the space
      and time components of a vector. In Chapter Twenty, I explained what this
      means in terms of physical behavior; rather than being able to make simple
      sums of vectors, we must account for the speed of light as an upper limit.
      We&apos;ll look at that a little more in-depth soon (Chapter Twenty-Three), but
      first let&apos;s compare the equations and the graphs of circles and hyperbolas
      to one another.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/circle-vs-hyperbola.png"

          style="max-height: 600px;"></p>
      <p><b>Figure 21-7.</b>   The unit circle in relation to the
        hyperbolas having semi-major axes of length one.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The equation for a circle of radius 1 is shown in Figure 21-7, along with
      its graph. Think of this circle as representing all of the different ways
      that a meter-long arrow could be measured on a grid of coordinates. From
      head to tail, there might be a distance of one meter down and zero meters
      left or right; or perhaps 0.71 meters up and 0.71 meters right. The
      measurements would vary depending on the orientation of the coordinate
      grid, but each of these pairs of measurements would be found somewhere on
      the red circle. We use the Pythagorean theorem to tell us how to add up
      the components, as reflected in the equation for the circle. For speeds
      much lower than the speed of light, we could use a similar equation to
      calculate the approximate sum of two velocities: to make a simple linear
      combination or superposition of two vectors. If Zeno stands in the truck
      bed and drops something which falls at 3 meters per second while the truck
      itself moves perpendicularly to the right at 4 meters per second, then
      Alice standing at the roadside will see the object fall 5 meters per
      second downward and to the right.</p>
    <p>But relativity, with its hyperbolic math, turns the circle inside out
      into a hyperbola. Instead of an arrow&apos;s length with <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
      components in an endless number of arbitrary coordinate grids, we now lay
      the arrow onto an <i>x</i> axis that is shared in common by several
      coordinate systems, and we will consider the separation of the arrow&apos;s two
      ends in space and time having components <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>. Each
      of these coordinate systems will have the same orientation in space, but
      will be in relative motion to one another along their common <i>x</i>
      axis. We are at rest in relation to the arrow and hold up a meter-stick to
      it, measuring its two ends at the same time and finding them to be one
      meter apart. In order for us to compare our measurements to those made
      from other frames of reference, we place high-precision clocks at either
      end of the arrow, and synchronize them. We have them blink in unison every
      ten seconds, and these blinks will mark pairs of events for us to compare
      measurements on. We measure that the blinks happen simultaneously, one
      meter apart.</p>
    <p>The equations for hyperbolas representing an invariant intervals of 1 are
      also shown in Figure 21-7, along with their graphs. I will now explain
      their physical significance, which is very much like the significance of
      the circle in the previous example. Our measurement (of one meter distance
      in space and no difference in time) lies both on the red circle and the
      right-hand blue hyperbola in Figure 21-7, at the <i>x</i> and <i>t</i> coordinates
      (1,0). Observers in any of the other (moving) frames of reference
      mentioned previously can also measure the difference in distance between
      the two ends of the arrow and the difference in time between the two
      clocks sitting on either end. They will find the arrow to be shorter and
      the clocks to be slower and out of sync. But the space and time distances
      they measure between any pair of <q>blink</q> events will be greater than ours
      and will lie on some other point of that same blue hyperbola. They will
      measure the two blinks not to be simultaneous, therefore having a greater
      separation in time; and because the observers are in motion, they will
      have moved some distance in the time between the first and second blinks,
      and this will cause their space measurement between the two events to be
      greater as well.</p>
    <p>For every point on the blue hyperbola, there is some associated relative
      velocity that will result in the corresponding measurements of space and
      time distance between the pair of blinks that we measure as being
      simultaneous at time <i>t</i>=0. Some of these velocities will measure
      the clock at the head of the arrow to blink first; velocities in the
      opposite direction will measure the clock at the tail of the arrow to
      blink first.</p>
    <p>The same hyperbolic relationship is true of <q>timelike</q> event pairs as
      well. If we have just one clock, remaining in place and blinking once per
      second, the spacetime separation between blinks will have <i>x</i> and <i>t</i> components corresponding to the point (0,1) in Figure 21-7, where
      the red circle meets the upper green hyperbola. But observers in very fast
      motion relative to us will measure that these blinks are less frequent as
      well as happening at successive points along a line rather than happening
      all in the same place; they will measure greater separation in both time
      and space, and these components of measurement will all lie on the upper
      green hyperbola in Figure 21-7.
   </p>
    <p>For every pair of events <i>ct</i><sub>1</sub>±<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>
      in the upper cone of Figure ii-9 (repeated below), there is a hyperbola
      joining them; and there is a frame of reference in which one event or the
      other is in the same location as the event (0,0) and in which the time
      duration between that event and (0,0) is the value of <i>t</i> where
      the hyperbola crosses the <i>t</i> axis. Where one observer might
      measure <i>ct</i>+<i>x</i>, another might measure <i>ct</i>-<i>x</i>.</p>
    <p>Likewise, for every pair of events <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>±<i>ct</i><sub>2</sub>
      in the right-hand quarter of Figure ii-9, there is a hyperbola joining
      them; and there is a frame of reference in which one event or the other is
      simultaneous to the event (0,0) and in which the distance between that
      event and (0,0) is the value of <i>x</i> where the hyperbola crosses
      the <i>x</i> axis. Where one observer might measure <i>x+ct</i>,
      another might measure <i>x-ct</i>.</p>

    <p>This is what is meant by <q>rotation</q> in the context of spacetime. It isn&apos;t
      that you can choose among coordinate systems along a circle and make the
      time coordinate diminish while the space coordinate increases; neither can
      you trade off an extent in space for an extent in time, though this sort
      of trade-off is exactly the way we tend to think about <q>rotation</q> in
      everyday Euclidean spaces (for example, in Figure 3-4 width and depth
      change places). In spacetime measurements, the time and space coordinates
      between events increase or decrease together as you change coordinate
      systems, as shown on the hyperbolas associated with any fixed interval.</p>
    <p>In three-dimensional space, rotations are often described using sine and
      cosine functions operating on coordinates. In Minkowski space, those
      circular trig functions (sin and cos) can be replaced by their hyperbolic
      counterparts (sinh and cosh) to accomplish the <q>hyperbolic rotations</q> that
      correspond to a change of reference frame. In Equations 20-4 and 20-5. we
      put these transformations in terms of <i>&gamma;</i> and <i>&beta;</i> in
      a way which turns out to be mathematically equivalent.</p>
    <p>I could go on to explain all of that, but I think I will instead refer
      the reader to a video (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km7WTO_6K5s&amp;t=300">Relativity
        104e: Special Relativity - Spacetime Interval and Minkowski Metric</a>)
      by eigenchris for the details. And in case you might wonder: no, the
      hyperbolic angle that the sinh and cosh functions operate on to perform
      the rotation is <em>not</em> the angle I used in defining <i>&gamma;</i><i> </i>as
      1/cos <i>&theta;</i> (Equation 20-2).  
   </p>
    <p>We won&apos;t be doing anything with hyperbolic trig here, but it&apos;s 
      interesting to note that the sinh and cosh functions have a definition
      much like their circular counterparts. Whereas <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><i><sup><i>&theta;</i></sup></i>
      = cos <i>&theta;</i> + <i>i</i> sin <i><i>&theta;</i></i> (Equation
      i-2)<i>,</i> <i>e<sup>x</sup></i><i><sup></sup></i> = cosh
      <i>x</i> + sin <i>x</i>. </p>
    <p>We&apos;ll get to how velocities are added relativistically in Chapter
      Twenty-Three, and we will see a little more of the hyperbola there.</p>

    <h3 id="PinMII">Chapter Twenty-Two<br>
      Perspective in Motion (II) </h3>
    <p>Up to this point in our exploration of relativity, we have been
      discussing only the differences in <em>measurements</em> between various
      frames of reference. In this chapter we&apos;ll spend some time visualizing
      what special relativity <q>looks like.</q> It is our great fortune to have as a
      resource a video game developed for this purpose. In 2012, the MIT game
      lab released <q>A Slower Speed of Light,</q> in which the speed of light
      approaches the player&apos;s own walking speed as gameplay progresses. You can
      <a href="http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/" target="_blank">download
        </a>the game for free and play it yourself, and The Action Lab has a
      great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udqihUBGuZ8" target="_blank">12-minute
        overview</a> of it on YouTube which explains the physics behind the
      game&apos;s behavior.</p>

    <p>The Doppler effect, which we mentioned in Chapter Six, is visible in the
      game in the way light changes color. As a wave phenomenon, light does
      change frequency depending on our speed relative to its propagation, just
      as the sound from a car or train changes frequency as it passes. The
      village that the game takes place in has huts with chimneys, and these
      chimneys may glow red as you approach them, due to the infrared light
      associated with their heat shifting upward into the visible portion of the
      spectrum.  The Doppler effect becomes more noticeable throughout the
      game, and if you move sideways you will see color shift toward the blue
      end (higher frequencies) of the spectrum on one side of the screen and
      toward the red (lower frequencies) on the opposite side. Later in the
      game, you may see the space ahead of you turn black as the light shifts
      frequency to a range above what is humanly visible.

    <p>One of the more surprising visual effects of relativity is a sort of
      <q>dolly zoom</q> effect, to borrow a term from filmmaking. Movie fans are
      likely to have seen at least one example of this effect, made famous in
      the Alfred Hitchcock film <q>Vertigo</q> and again in Steven Spielberg&apos;s 
      <q>Jaws.</q> 
      (A compilation of film clips can be seen <a href="https://vashivisuals.com/evolution-dolly-zoom/"

        target="_blank">here</a>.) The effect is typically that the foreground
      subject remains unchanged while the background changes size, and is
      achieved by changing the camera&apos;s zoom level while moving the camera
      toward or away from the main subject at a rate that balances out the zoom
      effect that on subject.</p>

    <p>It is one of relativity&apos;s symmetries that what we <em>measure</em> to
      be contracted in the direction of relative motion may <em>appear</em> elongated,
      due to the distortion of the angle of approach of incoming light. This
      effect, which is rather like the cinematic <q>dolly zoom,</q> is called by many
      names, including <dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_aberration"
          target="_blank">aberration</a>,</dfn> <q>relativistic beaming,</q> or the
      <q>searchlight effect.</q> As we leave a state of relative rest and begin
      moving forward at a significant fraction of the speed of light,
      approaching objects in the distance ahead of us will appear elongated and
      further away due to their locations now corresponding to events further
      back in time. If we walk backward, the effect is reversed, and now
      everything receding in front of us appears nearer and contracted. Passing
      objects &mdash; those not directly ahead of us or behind us &mdash; behave
      differently. Light from the far side of an passing object may take a
      significantly longer time to reach us than light from the near side, and
      for this reason it will appear rotated; this may be the strangest effect
      of all, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotation" target="_blank">Terrell
        rotation</a>. It&apos;s so non-intuitive that it took over fifty years after
      the publication of Einstein&apos;s special relativity for someone, namely John
      Terrell, to publish it.</p>

      The light delay due to radial distance also causes apparent curvatures, as
      seen in the screenshot below. The bases of the white pillars are relatively
      near to us as we pass between them, but their tops, being a greater radial
      distance away, appear in a position further in the past, which is further
      ahead of us; for this reason the pillars will appear curved as we pass
      between them. If we were to stop at the point shown below, the light from
      the top of the pillars would soon catch up, and they would appear straight
      again.

      due to special relativity with what we discussed in Chapter Ten and saw at
      the end of Chapter Three.

      Mechanical Perspective (II)</h3>
    <p>Our objective in this chapter will be to learn about <em>dynamics</em> in
      the context of relativity: how we must think about force, acceleration,
      momentum, and energy. Before we get into all that, I&apos;d like to say that
      this is one of the times that I am honestly using the pronouns <q>we</q> and
      <q>our</q> in more than an editorial sense when
       I write that <q>we</q> will be
      learning; this is a subject area that isn&apos;t as clear in my mind as I would
      like it to be, and I have every expectation that I will learn at least as
      much as the reader in the process of explaining it.</p>
    <p>The math for this next part isn&apos;t very pretty, so perhaps it&apos;s best to dress
    it up with a Socratic-style dialog (lacking a blackboard at the Non
    Sequitur, Einstein makes use of a serviette):</p>
    
    <h4>Velocity addition </h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Zeno:</b> <q class="dialog">Is it indeed impossible that any object will be measured
        to have a speed greater than the speed of light?</q></p>
      <p><b>Einstein:</b> <q class="dialog">It is so.</q></p>
      <p><b>Zeno:</b> <q class="dialog">Suppose that Alice is able to throw a stone at half the
        speed of light, and that she is in motion relative to you and I at
        three-quarters of the speed of light. Adding those two velocities in the
        classical manner, we might expect that Alice would be able to throw the
        stone with a speed of one-and-a-quarter times the speed of light. What
        troubles me is that by the principle of relativity, Alice is at rest in
        her own frame of reference, and should find herself able to throw the
        stone without regard to any other observer. And yet relativity also
        demands that the sum of the stone&apos;s velocity and the velocity of any
        other observer must not exceed the speed of light.</q>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>Einstein:</b> <q class="dialog">You are quite correct on those two points. Alice will
      find that her stone, after she throws it, has a speed of .5<i>c</i>,
      because she measures herself to be at rest. However you and I will measure
      the stone to have a speed less than the speed of light: in this case, 91
      percent of <i>c</i>.</q>
     </p>
      
      <p><b>Zeno:</b> <q class="dialog">So the velocities do combine to be larger than either
        individual velocity, but they do not add as a simple sum?</q></p>
      <p><b>Einstein:</b> <q class="dialog">Indeed. Alice&apos;s velocity <i>u</i> in our frame of
        reference and the velocity <i>v</i> of the stone in her frame of
        reference combine into the velocity <i>w</i> of the stone in our
        reference frame as follows:</q></p>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/bar-notes1.png" style="max-height: 100px;"></p>
      <p><b>Einstein:</b> <q class="dialog">That looks very complicated, but it follows from this:</q><!--#Duality. Adding and subtracting--></p>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/bar-notes2.png" style="max-height: 100px;">
        <!--Mermin, It&apos;s About Time, p. 37 --></p>
      <p><b>Zeno:</b> <q class="dialog">Or in other words, the discrepancy between the classical,
        Galilean addition and the relativistic addition of velocities is a
        matter of differences between the clocks and meter-sticks as compared
        between us and Alice?</q></p>
      <p><b>Einstein:</b> <q class="dialog">Yes sir.</q></p>
      <p><b>Zeno:</b> <q class="dialog">How very surprising. Suppose Alice is in a rocket ship
        having enormous amounts of fuel. Is it also true that Alice cannot
        herself accelerate to a speed equal to or greater than <i>c</i>?</q></p>
      <p><b>Einstein:</b> <q class="dialog">Yes, as Alice approaches the speed of light, her
        ship is measured to have more momentum. At speeds near <i>c</i>, this
        momentum becomes so large that it would require near-impossible amounts
        of energy to accelerate it.</q></p>
      <p><b>Zeno:</b> <q class="dialog">One might ask, Who tells Alice that she is near <i>c</i>
        and therefore near-infinite in momentum? This would also seem to violate
        the principle of relativity, as she measures herself to be at rest and
        therefore able to accelerate freely. But I must anticipate that the
        resolution to this seeming paradox also has to do with the difference
        between Alice&apos;s clock and ours, which is unaccelerated.</q></p>
      <p><b>Einstein:</b> <q class="dialog">Indeed, Alice will notice no difference if she
        measures strictly within her own frame of reference. From our point of
        view, however, once Alice nears the speed of light, she has gained too
        much momentum to be accelerated by any <em>external</em> force;
        furthermore, Alice&apos;s internal systems, her clocks, have slowed to the
        point where the rate of fuel supplied <em>internally</em> for
        acceleration is near zero from our point of view. We might say that
        Alice enters a new inertial frame of reference with each burst of
        acceleration provided by her rocket engines. And from moment to moment
        she is able to accelerate at the same rate within each successive frame
        of reference, regardless of her velocity with respect to us. But as she
        approaches a velocity of <i>c</i> relative to us, her rate of
        acceleration with respect to our frame of reference becomes slower. She
        is no longer accelerating efficiently with respect to us, but only with
        respect to each successive reference frame of her own.</q></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Uniform acceleration</h4>
    <p>It is often said that special relativity deals strictly with
      non-accelerating frames of reference, but that isn&apos;t true. As shown in the
      dialog above, to consider what happens in an accelerated frame of
      reference, we need only determine what happens in each of the inertial
      reference frames that are crossed along the way. The simplest case to
      consider is the frame of reference that is uniformly accelerated, that is,
      one that has constant acceleration. Constant according to whom? Constant
      to the person being accelerated, who feels an unchanging pressure on their
      feet from the floor of their rocketship underneath them, for instance. We
      call such acceleration <q>constant proper acceleration.</q> It turns out that
      the path of such a person through a frame of reference that is <em>unaccelerated</em>
      is in the shape of a hyperbola. You will recall from prior chapters that
      the curve associated with uniform acceleration in the classical paradigm
      is a <em>parabola</em>. Something being accelerated just keeps gaining
      speed, without limit. On a spacetime diagram, their path (or <q>worldline</q>)
      could become almost horizontal, crossing vast amounts of distance in very
      little time. But in the paradigm of relativity, where the limiting speed
      of light comes into play, an object&apos;s worldline on a spacetime can never
      become parallel with the angle made by the speed of light along the line <i>x</i>=<i>ct</i>.
      This line <i>x=ct</i> is called the <dfn>asymptote</dfn> of any
      hyperbola <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> - (<i>ct</i>)<sup>2</sup> = <i>k</i>,
      where <i>k</i> is some constant. At extremely high values of <i>x</i> and/or
      <i>ct</i>, the hyperbola will approach nearer this asymptote and become
      more aligned with its direction, but will not intersect or become parallel
      to it for any finite value of <i>x</i> or <i>ct</i> (see Figure
      23-1).</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>Wolfgang Rindler was a physicist who gave a great deal of thought to
      accelerated frames of reference, and for this reason a coordinate system
      associated with such a frame of reference is sometimes called <q>Rindler coordinates.</q> A Rindler coordinate system occupies something shaped like a
      light cone, but in-between the future and past light cones of a typical
      light cone diagram. The system is curvilinear, with lines of constant <i>x</i>
      lying on the hyperbolas shown in Figure 23-1 and lines of constant proper
      time being rays emanating from the origin (see Figure 23-2).</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>What&apos;s most interesting about the Rindler coordinate system is the
      Rindler horizon, a sort of sideways light cone in the right-hand quarter
      of a spacetime diagram. As unaccelerated observers, our <q>event horizon</q> is
      our past light cone, the bottom quarter of a spacetime diagram (Figure
      7-14). Any events too recent and too far away will not be visible to us.
      The Rindler horizon is the same boundary for an accelerated
      observer.  In Figure 23-2, if a light signal is sent from <i>x</i>=0
      at any time later than <i>t</i>=0, it will not reach any accelerated
      observer on one of the hyperbolic paths shown. It is only when these
      observers stop accelerating and continue on a straight-line path through
      the horizon boundary that these light signals will catch up to them.</p>
    <p>It is tempting to say that as long as they keep accelerating, the light
      will never catch up to them. And indeed, it has been said (Figure 23-3).
      But this presents a sort of paradox since the accelerating observers never
      exceed nor even reach the speed of light. It would be like Zeno arguing
      that Achilles can never overtake the tortoise even though he is running
      faster. Since there is no scenario in which the tortoise is able to keep
      accelerating indefinitely (she must eventually run out of fuel), I prefer
      to frame the problem in terms of <em>when</em> the acceleration stops,
      not <em>whether</em> or <em>if</em>.</p>

    <p><b>Momentum and force</b> </p>
    <p>In Chapter <i>i</i><sup>2</sup>, we established some standards for
      position and velocity vectors that would be invariant under a Lorentz
      transformation; in other words, we needed vector definitions that all
      unaccelerated observers could agree on when taking relativistic effects
      into account. Such vectors are called four-vectors. We can also define
      such vectors for representing momentum and force.</p>
    <p>The classical definition of a momentum vector <b>p</b> is mass
      times velocity, and we need only be more specific about what we mean by
      mass and velocity to make this definition usable in the context of
      relativity. We will need to break velocity down into the four components
      of spacetime rather than the classical three components of space. There
      are several equivalent formulas for doing this. The simplest is to clarify
      that by mass, we mean <q>proper mass</q> or rest mass <i>m</i><sub>0</sub>;
      this is the mass of the object as measured at rest.  We multiply this
      with a four-velocity vector <b>U</b> defined previously
      (Figure ii-11) to get the <q>four-momentum</q> vector <b>P</b> = <i>m</i><sub>0</sub><b>U</b>.
      To represent force as an invariant vector, a <q>four-force,</q> we divide each
      of the components of the four-momentum vector by proper time: <b>F</b>
      = d<b>P</b>/dτ. Classically, <b>F</b> = <i>m</i><b>a</b>
      = d<b>p</b>/dt.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Mass and energy</h4>
    <p>There have been a couple of hints so far that interesting things happen
      with mass, energy, and/or momentum measurements at high speeds where
      relativistic effects become noticeable. In the discussion between Zeno and
      Einstein above, Einstein implies that if Alice were to gain a velocity
      near the speed of light, she would also gain near-infinite momentum. As is
      often the case with physics, there is more than one way of looking at how
      this is so. In terms of the momentum four-vector, we chose a definition
      above in which the mass is always represented by the rest mass, and the
      velocity is represented by the four-vector <b>U</b>, having <i>x</i>,
      <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> components all multiplied by the Lorentz factor
      <i>&gamma;</i>. It is this <i>&gamma;</i> factor that increases without bound as
      Alice&apos;s velocity reaches <i>c</i>, and thus her momentum increases
      without bound as well. But there are other four-momentum definitions in
      which it is the <em>mass</em> that is multiplied by <i>&gamma;</i> rather
      than the velocities. Tomato, tomahto.Whichever way you slice it, Alice is
      moving very fast and cannot easily be knocked off-course due to her
      momentum.</p>
    <p>That may seem unreasonable to you. I weigh almost two hundred pounds and
      I would guess that Alice does not. If I were to reach out and give Alice&apos;s 
      hand a push, where would that energy go if it doesn&apos;t accelerate her hand?
      If we look at it that way, it is as though Alice really is more massive at
      very high speeds. The kinetic energy exchanged between us would result in
      a much bigger change of velocity for my hand than it would for hers.</p>
    <p>What if we look at it from Alice&apos;s point of view? Not only does she weigh
      less to begin with, but now in her frame of reference my momentum is
      nearly limitless. If our hands were to exchange kinetic energy in a
      collision, she must measure a bigger change of velocity with regard to her
      hand in comparison to the change in velocity of my hand. Can it work both
      ways? It can, in fact, due to the differences between us in the way time
      is measured. Now that we are looking at matters from Alice&apos;s viewpoint,
      everything that happens to her speeds up, including the velocity of her
      hand as a result of it being pushed; and everything having to do with me
      slows down.</p>
    <p>In order for momentum to be conserved in such circumstances<!--Steane 84-85-->,
      it must be the case that mass and energy are equivalent; and the
      relationship between the two is the famous <i>E</i>=<i>mc</i><sup>2</sup>.
      One possible answer to the question of <q>where does the energy go</q> in an
      exchange where the velocity of a smaller Alice is relatively unaffected in
      a collision with me seems to be that the energy is exchanged as mass. If
      Alice rushes past me at nearly the speed of light and I manage to give her
      a push in her direction of motion, her gain in velocity will be <em>less
     </em> than expected in classical terms of <b>F</b>=<i>m</i><sub>0</sub><b>a</b>
      but her gain in momentum will be <em>more</em> than expected in terms of
      <b>F</b>=d<b>p</b>/dt. One could say that she gains
      mass in the exchange, and this used to be a more common way to describe
      the change; but because her <em>proper mass</em> remains invariant (and
      we <em>like</em> to think in terms of invariants), it is becoming more
      common to say that she gains momentum and energy.</p>
    <p>In the years since <i>E</i>=<i>mc</i><sup>2</sup> we have often been
      told that mass is <q>frozen energy,</q> but seldom if ever do we get an
      explanation of what this means. How does energy become <q>frozen</q> and how
      does its behavior change in that process? 
      <!--III:22 (Ferris 194): <q>matter is frozen energy</q> Frozen how?  -->I hope
      to offer some insight into this in this book&apos;s concluding chapter.</p>
    <p>It may be helpful to return to the light clock model (Figure 20-2) when
      considering relativistic momentum and energy. At speeds approaching <i>c</i>,
      the mirrors and the light pulse between them are all traveling in nearly
      the same direction; the light pulse is moving in the <q>space</q> direction
      with the mirrors rather than in the <q>time</q> direction between them, and the
      time component of its velocity four-vector (if we use the convention shown
      in Figures 20-6 and ii-10) becomes zero. There is no more tick-tock,
      zigzag component of the light pulse&apos;s motion to be sacrificed in favor of
      following the mirrors in their increasingly fast journey across space.
      That is another meaning and consequence of the momentum the clock has at
      speeds near <i>c</i>. The clock is effectively stopped, and you can&apos;t
      slow it down by pushing on the mirrors to make them go faster any more
      than you could have made a clock at rest go faster by holding the mirrors
      steady. You can&apos;t easily slow the mirrors down from such a high speed,
      either, because all the energy that went into getting them to go that fast
      in the first place has to be spent again to slow them down; it&apos;s more than
      just the classical kinetic energy of half the mirrors&apos; rest mass times <i>c</i>
      squared, because the Lorentz factor comes into play.</p>
    <p>Discussions of mass and energy in special relativity lead us toward
      general relativity, which deals with gravity. In <a href="#ComeBackToThis345">Chapter
        Twenty</a> we compared Alice and Zeno&apos;s measurements of the time elapsed
      during the fall of Zeno&apos;s lump of mashed potatoes: <q>While in relative motion, Alice would say that Zeno&apos;s clock was slow; Zeno would say the same of Alice, and that the force of gravity on the lump was stronger than Alice measured it to be.</q> Zeno, who was in relative motion with the Earth,
      found that the lump fell a little faster; this is because in his frame of
      reference, the moving Earth had more energy/momentum, and therefore a
      stronger gravitational pull. Classically, gravity is attributable to mass;
      but in general relativity (as we shall soon see), mass, energy, and
      momentum are all sources of gravity.</p>
    <h4>Oscillatory motion</h4>
    <p>An interesting aspect of relativity that is often overlooked concerns
      oscillatory motion that is uniform over some area in some frame of
      reference: for example, the flat surface of a bathroom scale that bounces
      up and down on the springs of the scale. In the frame of reference in
      which the scale is at rest, every point on that flat surface might be
      expected to rise and fall at the same time, with each point being equal in
      height at all times. We would say that the rising and falling of these
      points happen in phase with one another. This would not be so in a frame
      of reference in which the scale is moving horizontally. Since the leading
      end and trailing ends of the scale are not simultaneous when compared
      between two reference frames, the events along the axis of motion
      demonstrate a phase that changes with position as well as time. As a
      result, the surface of the scale rises and falls in a rippling fashion,
      depending on the relative velocity of the scale in that frame of reference
      and how that velocity compares with the scale&apos;s vertical oscillation.</p>
    <p>In this moving frame of reference, where the scale moves with velocity <i>v</i>
      = <i>&beta;c</i>, the up-and-down bouncing of the scale&apos;s flat surface slows
      down by a factor of 1/<i>&gamma;</i>, like the ticking of a clock. But the
      ripples moving across the scale&apos;s surface have a <em>faster</em> frequency,
      multiplied by <i>&gamma;</i> rather than divided, and these remain
      in phase with the up-and-down motion of the scale at each point only by
      virtue of their horizontal speed being <em>higher</em> than the speed of
      light, such that their <q>phase velocity</q> is <i>c/&beta;</i>. For example if <i>&beta;
     </i> is 0.8 and <i>v</i>=0.8<i>c</i>, then the ripples will move
      across the surface at 1.25<i>c</i> (one divided by 0.8).</p>
    <p>If this seems impossible, remember that crowds gathered in an arena can
      do <q>the wave</q> with a much faster phase velocity than any of them are
      capable of running individually. Or think about shining a laser pointer at
      the moon and making a red dot move across its surface faster than the
      speed of light with a flick of your wrist. Some phenomena can change
      position at speeds greater than <i>c</i>, but <em>causation</em> is
      limited to the speed of light.</p>
    <p>We&apos;ll discuss phase velocity a great deal more in Chapter Twenty-Six and
      relate it to <dfn>group velocity</dfn>, which would be the velocity of the
      scale. It turns out that associated waves having phase velocities that
      depend on their frequencies create fascinating interference patterns, and
      these patterns are critical in quantum mechanics. Everything I have
      related in these past few paragraphs derives from a scientific paper
      written in 1924 by Louis de Broglie  (<q><b><i>loo-ee de-broy</i></b></q>)
      not about relativity <i>per se</i>, but about quantum mechanics and the
      wave nature of matter (if I have interpreted it correctly). For a
      visualization of the waviness caused by relative motion, check out this

      Electromagnetism (II) </h3>
    <p>We might well have begun our discussion of relativity with
      electromagnetism, because that is how Einstein himself did it. His first
      paper on relativity in 1905 was entitled <q><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_Electrodynamics_of_Moving_Bodies_%281920_edition%29"
        target="_blank">On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies</a></q> and began
      by pointing out a curious feature of physics having to do with currents
      and magnets. If a conductor is near a moving magnet, Einstein said, we say
      that the moving magnet produces an electric field that may induce current
      in the conductor. If, on the other hand, the magnet is stationary and the
      conductor moves, we say that the electrical field remains unchanged but an
      <q>electromotive force</q> induces the same current as in the former case. Why
      should it matter whether it is the conductor or the magnet that moves if
      their relative motion is the same and results in the same current? The two
      scenarios have what might be called <q>equivalence.</q></p>
    <p>Rather than a conductor and a magnet, let&apos;s look at some scenarios
      involving electric charge that demonstrate similar <q>equivalences.</q> We are
      going to blur the distinction between electric charge and magnetism, and
      between rotation and revolution.</p>
    <p>One of the more perplexing interactions of electricity and magnetism is
      the way the motion of a charged particle can be diverted by a magnetic
      field. I will give three examples (most of which are silly) which all
      exhibit this strange behavior. First, Let&apos;s stand an imaginary bar magnet
      on end with the north pole at the top. Now we&apos;ll shoot negatively-charged
      particles at it (Figure 24-1). All of the particles get diverted to the
      right and miss their target, without losing speed. The angle of their
      deflection depends on their velocity, mass and charge, and on the strength
      of the magnet.</p>

        slingshot.<br>

        if revolving in relation to our car, as a target for an electron
        slingshot. This revolution appears similar to the rotation in Figure
        24-3.<br>
        <b>Figure 24-3</b>. A rotating, charged mountain as target for
        stationary electron slingshot. The rotating charges create the same
        magnetic field as the bar magnet in Figure 24-1.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For our second and third examples, let&apos;s go back to the freeway near
      Conway (see Chapters Ten and Twelve). Directly out the right-hand window
      on the other side of the plowed field is Little Mountain, which somehow we
      have managed to imbue with a large positive charge. We are traveling at
      freeway speed and we shoot some positive charges at it (Figure 24-2).
      Again, the charges are diverted to the right and miss the target. Now we
      stop the car and &mdash; through some marvelous feat of engineering &mdash; we pull a
      lever and cause the mountain to rotate in place (Figure 24-3). We shoot
      more positive charges at it, and again they are deflected to the right.</p>
    <p>All three experiments produce the same result because they all have
      equivalence. In the first case we have a magnet, which we understand to
      contain a collection of subatomic charges having a property called <q>spin.</q>
      In the third case, we cause the charges in the mountain to rotate,
      effectively inducing it to gain a magnetic field.</p>
    <p>The second case would have been less obvious if not for our discussion in
      Chapters Ten and Twelve, particularly Equation 12-4. Our motion relative
      to the mountain gives it an angular velocity in our frame of reference.
      This situation is equivalent to it rotating. As we established in Chapter
      Ten, the angular velocity of the mountain directly out our side window is
      inversely proportional to the square of its distance from our car. Since
      the angular velocity is the source of the magnetic field, we should not be
      surprised to find that the strength of the magnetic field is inversely
      proportional to the square of our distance from it. As our charged
      particles fly downrange toward the mountain, they retain the same linear
      velocity that our car has on the freeway. As they get closer to the
      mountain, the angular velocity of the mountain with respect to them
      increases exponentially, and therefore the magnetic field strength due to
      the apparent rotation of the mountainous charge increases at the same
      rate.</p>
    <p>The equivalence of our motion past the mountain and the rotation of the
      mountain is important to note. In both cases, there is an angular velocity
      at work in our frame of reference. Not all observers will measure magnetic
      force from the charged mountain. In the second example, we only measure
      magnetic force because we are in relative motion on the freeway. Someone
      standing in the field will not measure the magnetic force. The mountain
      does not become magnetized just because we are moving past it. It doesn&apos;t
      notice us and does not care. We create the magnetic force by our own
      motion. In the third example, we measure magnetic force from the charged
      mountain because we see it rotating on whatever massive machinery it is
      connected to. But anyone who is on the mountain will not notice any
      magnetism from the charged mountain. They will not find, for instance,
      that metal objects in their pockets are pulled toward the ground. From
      their frame of reference, the mountain is not rotating.</p>
    <p>That gives us our quantitative, mathematical explanation. We know how
      much the charges from our slingshot will be diverted. But we still haven&apos;t
      discussed the qualitative explanation, the reason why. Why do the charges
      get diverted sideways and why do they maintain or  even gain speed in
      the process? There&apos;s another type of <q>slingshot</q> to talk about, which is a
      <q>gravitational slingshot.</q> You may have read about it or seen it in a
      movie. This term refers to a maneuver in which a spacecraft passes close
      by a large mass, and if it can hit a <q>sweet spot</q> in its gravitational
      field, it can get a boost in speed and a change in direction. What we see
      illustrated in Figures 24-1 through 24-3 is similar, but with electric
      charge rather than gravity.</p>
    <p>I have described several situations, some of which are equivalent to one
      another even though they appear somewhat different. Equivalence is one of
      the key concepts of relativity. Relativity says that when there is no
      background to measure against, there can be no distinction between being
      in uniform motion and being at rest; these two states are equivalent. To
      say that you are in motion is meaningless unless you specify, <q>I am in
      motion relative to the ground.</q> When several observers are in uniform
      motion but have no other standard to measure against, any of them can base
      their coordinate system on the assumption that they are at rest and the
      others are moving, and their measurements will match the expected laws of
      physics. But none of them can say that &mdash; since they assume themselves to
      be at rest and the others to be in motion &mdash; they are any sort of special
      case. Each of their situations are equivalent. If any of the observers
      collide, everyone will agree that momentum was conserved in the collision,
      even though they may disagree on the velocities involved.</p>
    <p>The same equivalence applies to relative motion between a bar magnet and
      a surrounding coil of wire. Whether we say the magnet is at rest and the
      coil is moving, or vice versa, or that both are in motion, we will still
      measure the same voltage in the coil as long as the difference between the
      magnet&apos;s motion and the coil&apos;s has the same mathematical value. The
      principle of equivalence extends to angular motion as well as linear
      motion. Whether we are running in a circle around a charged body, running
      in a straight line past it, or at rest while the entire body rotates, or
      at rest while the individual charges in the body rotate in alignment, or
      if both we and the charged body are in motion, we will measure a magnetic
      field around that body in direct proportion to the difference in angular
      velocity between us and its charges.</p>
    <p>There&apos;s an interesting sort of functional equivalence here between
      rotation and revolution as well. Rotation is something spinning in place,
      whereas revolution involves something traveling in a circular (or
      elliptical) path around some point (or pair of points; more on this in the
      next chapter).  We might think of them in terms of the angular
      velocity <i>&omega;</i> and linear velocity <i>&part;&theta;</i>/<i>&part;t</i> we
      talked about during our analysis of Equation 12-4, with the angular
      velocity <i>&omega;</i> representing the rotation of the barn in Figure
      10-3, the way the barn presents different sides as we pass; and the linear
      velocity <i>&part;&theta;</i>/<i>&part;t</i> representing its apparent
      revolution around our car, or the way we need to turn our head to see it
      as it passes by. The near-equivalence of these two quantities is apparent
      in Equation 12-7.</p>
    <p>If you really want to blur the distinction between rotation and
      revolution, imagine yourself walking clockwise in a circle, revolving
      around some point. At one point in the circle, you face north. One quarter
      revolution further along, you face east. Another quarter further along the
      circumference of the circle, and you are facing south. Then west, and so
      on. Do you see where I am going with this? Now imagine that the circle is
      only half as wide, and repeat your path. You face in all the directions
      over the course of the circle. Repeat until the circle is too small to be
      considered a circle at all, and you find that you are no longer revolving,
      simply rotating. But since you have volume, all the parts of you each have
      a radius from your center and are revolving around that center.</p>
    <p>The rotational and revolutionary movement of the earth is another great
      example of how these two different phenomena relate as angular velocities.
      The earth rotates slightly more than 360 degrees per day, completing one
      rotation every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to the
      stars in the sky. This means that it rotates 360.9856 degrees every 24
      hours, what we will call a <q>day.</q> But the earth also revolves 360 degrees
      around the sun every 365.25 <q>days,</q> so that each day it completes 0.9856
      degrees of this revolving orbit. These two rotations are in opposite
      directions with respect to the sun, so that we can subtract one from the
      other to get the 360-degree rotation of the earth relative to the sun
      precisely every 24 hours.</p>
    <p>There is a property in quantum mechanics called <q>spin,</q> and all electrons
      are said to have it. There is no radius of rotation or revolution
      associated with this property, because if the electron or any part of it
      were to accelerate its direction around some point, then it would lose the
      energy required to create the electromagnetic waves associated with this
      acceleration. All the same, this <q>spin</q> is an angular velocity that
      induces a magnetic field equivalent to those in each of the situations
      depicted in Figures 24-1 through 24-3; and if another charged particle
      approaches it directly in the plane of its spin, it will experience
      magnetic force.</p>
    <p>It seems that the fundamental cause of magnetic force is three-fold,
      meaning there must be some combination of three conditions. One is that
      the force must be between two masses having electric charge. The second is
      that there must be relative velocity between these charges, whether
      radially or tangent to the radial distance between them. The third is that
      there must be a relative angular velocity between them.</p>
    <p>This third condition simplifies the more common conception of magnetic
      force, which posits the existence of a magnetic field <i>B</i> separate
      from the electric field <i>E</i> and specifies that the force occurring
      indirectly due to <i>B</i> is the vector cross-product of <i>B</i>
      and the velocity <i>v</i> of charge <i>q.</i> This can all be more
      directly visualized as the angular velocity of the electric field <i>E</i>
      surrounding a charge <i>q</i> having velocity <i>v</i>, which we
      derived somewhat laboriously from Equation 12-4 and rewrote as Equation
      12-7. We may eventually find that charge is what is fundamental and that
      magnetism emerges as a side effect that may disappear in a carefully
      chosen reference frame; more likely, we will conclude that both charge and
      <q>spin</q> are inseparable aspects of a quantum reality that underlies them
      both and eludes our efforts to describe it in classical or macroscopic
      terms. We will revisit electron spin magnetism in Chapter Twenty-Seven.</p>
    <p>Whatever the fundamental causes of the electric and magnetic fields may
      be, their effects are well-understood and since Einstein&apos;s time they have
      been combined into a single mathematical context called the <dfn>electromagnetic
        tensor field</dfn>, which replaces the separate vector fields. Rather
      than two vectors at each point in space, we can think of a single tensor
      associated with each point. The extent to which a given observer sees
      electric or magnetic effects arising from the field depends on their frame
      of reference, namely their velocity. As with the vectors we have discussed
      in previous chapters, the EM tensor can be represented in various
      coordinate bases, varying order of components, and in different terms. But
      for any given form as a standard, observers can agree on the equivalence
      of how they each measure the tensor; it is an <em>invariant</em> quantity
      with variable components. The tensor has sixteen components arranged in
      four rows and four columns. Four components are zeroes arranged in
      diagonal fashion; on either side of this diagonal there are three
      components for the three components of the electric field in space and
      three for the magnetic field in space; the components on opposite sides
      are redundant and each the negative of the other. </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Electric charge is another invariant in relativity. Charge density and
      current density vary between reference frames, but combine into another
      invariant vector quantity called <dfn>four-current</dfn>. We get this vector
      by adding charge density <i>&rho;</i> times <i>c</i> as a fourth
      component along with the three space components of current density: <b>J</b> 
      = (c<i>&rho;</i>,J<sub>x</sub>,J<sub>y</sub>,J<sub>z</sub>). An
      observer in the same frame of reference as the average current density in
      a volume will measure that current density to be zero and will measure a
      charge density of <i>&rho;</i><sub>0</sub>, what might be called a <q>proper charge density.</q> An observer in a different reference frame, in relative
      motion to the charges, will measure both a current density due to that
      relative motion, and (because of Lorentz contraction) a higher value of
      charge density.  But if all observers do the same hyperbolic math
      with these densities as they do for calculating the spacetime interval
      (Chapter <i>i</i><sup>2</sup>), they will all agree on the magnitude of
      <b>J</b>. In this case, the calculation is |<b>J</b>|<sup>2</sup>
      = (c<i>&rho;</i>)<sup>2</sup> - (J<sub>x</sub>)<sup>2</sup> - (J<sub>y</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
      - (J<sub>z</sub>)<sup>2</sup> .</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>&part;</i><i>F<sup>&alpha;&beta;</sup></i>/ <i>&part;x<sup>&alpha;</sup></i> = <i>&mu;<sub>0</sub>J<sup>&beta;</sup></i>
        <br>
        <b>Equation 24-1</b>. <span class="equation_description">The equation
        relating the EM tensor in Figure 24-4 to the four-current vector. <i>&mu;</i><sub>0</sub>
        is the constant seen in Maxwell&apos;s equations. This is actually four
        equations in one; <i>J<sup>&beta;</sup></i>stands for each of the four
        rows of elements  in the EM tensor. Setting <i>&beta;</i>=0, for
        example, and adding up the elements in the top row with their matching
        partial derivatives, we get Maxwell&apos;s equation for the divergence of the
        electric field E (Equations 11-10 and 12-1). The remaining three rows
        give us the curl of the magnetic field B (Equations 11-1 and
        12-4). </span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The four-current vector is what makes the electromagnetic field tensor
      useful. Every component <i>F<sup>&alpha;&beta;</sup></i>of the EM tensor will
      change in value over an incremental change of time or position (<i>&part;x<sup>&alpha;</sup></i>),
      and there is a tensor equation that specifies a component of <b>J</b>
      as being related to that change (Figure 24-5).
      <!--Fleisch SGVT 178-179.-->It&apos;s all very clever, but at the end of the
      day, what comes out of it are the same equations we have from Maxwell and
      Heaviside. For more details, I recommend Dan Fleisch&apos;s <em>A Student&apos;s 
        Guide to Vectors and Tensors</em>.</p>
    <h4>The Stadium Paradox</h4>
    <p>I am really comfortable with special relativity. It feels like a shoe
      that has been broken in and has started to conform to the shape of my
      foot. I see the ways that the theory is consistent both with itself and
      with experimental fact &hellip; except in one case. And it&apos;s really odd that
      this one case, the idea that I just can&apos;t seem to digest, would be so
      connected to the very foundation of the theory. It concerns the behavior
      of an electric charge near a circuit, and I&apos;ll borrow the explanation of
      it from Wolfson and Pasachoff&apos;s <!--p. 1035-36--> <cte>Physics for
        Scientists and Engineers</cite>. Suppose that we have a straight length of
      current-carrying wire along the <i>x</i> axis of our coordinate system,
      and there are negative charges in it moving to our left with velocity <b>u</b>,
      and positive charges moving to the right at the same speed. Everything is
      balanced out so that there is no net charge in the wire creating an
      electric field; there is just a magnetic field <b>B</b> induced
      by the current. Along comes a particle carrying (positive) charge <i>q</i>
      and moving along the wire toward the right with velocity <b>v</b>.
      The magnetic force on the particle will be q<b>v</b> x <b>B</b>,
      which is toward the wire. So far so good.</p>
    <p>But then, we look at the situation in the reference frame of the charged
      particle. The negative charges now have a velocity greater than <b>u
        (u+v)</b> in the direction to the left, and the positive charges
      are moving relatively more slowly by the same amount. There is still an
      electric current, but the particle is stationary in its own reference
      frame (<b>v</b>=0), so q<b>v</b> x <b>B</b> equals
      zero and there is no magnetic force on it. Uh oh. So where does the force
      come from that is accelerating the particle in every other frame of
      reference? The answer we are given is that there is an <em>electric</em> field
      acting on the charge in this case, one that arises due to length
      contraction not of the wire and everything in it, but from an <em>unequal
     </em> contraction between the negative charges on one hand and the positive
      charges on the other. Since the negative charges have greater velocity in
      this frame of reference, and since charge is invariant, the distance
      between them must contract to a greater extent, creating a greater density
      of negative charge.</p>
    <p>This inequality of contraction between the two sets of charges is a hard
      pill to swallow. It reminds me too much of Zeno&apos;s <q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#The_moving_rows_%28or_stadium%29"
        target="_blank">Stadium Paradox</a>,</q> at least the only surviving
      account of it given by Aristotle in these vague terms: <q>&hellip; concerning the two rows of bodies, each row being composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size, passing each other on a race-course as they proceed with equal velocity in opposite directions, the one row originally occupying the space between the goal and the middle point of the course and the other that between the middle point and the starting-post. This &hellip; involves the conclusion that half a given time is equal to double that time.</q></p>
    <p>I might be able to reject Wolfson and Pasachoff&apos;s reasoning, but in
      Steane&apos;s <cite>Relativity Made Relatively Easy</cite>, all the math is there
      to see. In the reference frame of the current-carrying wire, the charge
      density <i>&rho;</i> is zero and the current density is the current <i>I</i>
      in the positive <i>x</i> direction divided by the cross-sectional area
      <i>A</i> of the wire. So the four-current <b>J</b> is (0,
      I/A, 0, 0).  To find the charge density <i>&rho;&prime;</i> in the
      reference frame of the free charge outside the wire, we find<!--Steane 151-52-->
      that <i>&rho;&prime;</i> = <i>&gamma;</i>(<i>&rho; -</i> <b>vj</b>/<i>c</i>)<sup>2</sup>
      = <i>-&gamma;</i><b>v</b><i>I</i>/(<i>Ac</i>)<sup>2</sup>,
      which is not zero (compare Equation 20-4, and substitute <i>&rho;</i> for
      <i>t</i>, <i>j</i> for <i>x</i>). Steane also provides the clue I
      need to resolve the question of how charge can be conserved in a
      coordinate transformation which changes charge density from neutral to
      negative: we have to consider the other (far) side of the electric
      circuit, where everything flows in the opposite direction. On that side,
      the charge density must be net positive by the same reasoning that it is
      negative on the near side. What I had failed to consider until now is that
      the charges in the circuit are all <em>accelerating</em>, going in one
      direction in the segment of wire shown in my textbooks but then turning a
      corner and going in the opposite direction on the other side of the
      circuit. They are all intermittently joining and then leaving several
      different frames of reference, one of which may be similar to that of the
      charged particle outside the circuit.</p>
    <p>Both texts point out that this is an extraordinary result, but I think
      its implications are still underappreciated. Consider that in every other
      scenario we have studied, we assumed that the changes in our measurements
      of time and space were applicable <em>uniformly</em>. Alice and Zeno
      might disagree on how long it took for the lump of mashed potatoes to fall
      from Zeno&apos;s hand to the truck bed (Chapters Six and Twenty), and even on
      what <i>x</i> coordinate to assign any point along the way, but they
      would <em>not</em> disagree on whether Alice was standing alongside the
      moving truck at the same moment that the lump struck the truck bed, and
      certainly not disagree on which side of the truck she was on. And yet, a
      conductor which has a uniform charge distribution in one frame of
      reference can demonstrate polarity from side to side in another reference
      frame. Which premise is easier to accept: that Zeno&apos;s motion causes some
      of the charges on either side of his truck to relocate, or that it causes
      some of them to switch polarity? And in either case, what criteria
      determine which charges are affected? No, I don&apos;t think we&apos;re done here by
      any means, and the questions that remain have a very quantum-mechanical
      <q>feel</q> to them.

    <h4>Amp&egrave;re&apos;s Law redux</h4>
    <p>On that note, there&apos;s still something nagging at me from Chapter Twelve,
      and that&apos;s Equation 12-4, also known as Amp&egrave;re&apos;s circuital law.</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/e12-4.png" style="max-height:50px;">
     </p>
      <b>Equation 12-4</b> (repeated).  <span class="equation_description">Amp&egrave;re&apos;s circuital law.</span></blockquote>
    <p>I thought that of the two right-hand-side quantities, <b>J</b>
      and <i>&part;</i><b>E</b><i>/&part;t</i>, visualizing <i>&part;</i><b>E</b><i>/&part;t</i>
      would be the trickiest part. After all, electric current is pretty
      straightforward. Or is it? Now that we see how both of those aspects of
      the magnetic field arise from the movement of charged particles (either
      singly or <i>en masse</i>) in a particular direction, we might think we
      see how exactly how the two are related. It&apos;s only natural that we would
      want to be able to put one in terms of the other so that the right-hand
      side of Equation 12-4 to be all one thing or the other: all current or all
      individual charges. We can&apos;t easily dispense with <i>&part;</i><b>E</b><i>/&part;t
       </i> because without it, we could have no electromagnetic waves in empty
      space where there are no charged particles and therefore no current <b>I</b>
      and no current density <b>J</b>. Can we somehow replace J by
      putting it in terms of <i>&part;</i><b>E</b><i>/&part;t</i>? At first
      glance, it seems clear. We just consider each electron in the current flow
      one at a time. As it passes along the length of wire, it causes the E
      field to change in a consistent direction over time. The resulting vector
      <i>&part;</i><b>E</b><i>/&part;t</i> points in the direction of
      current <b>I</b> and current density <b>J</b>. The
      same happens for each successive electron, one at a time. Problem solved,
      right? Not exactly. When you fill the conducting wire with electrons and
      let them all flow <em>at the same time</em>, then the electric field <b>E</b>
       never changes. The electric potential is the same at any
      given point in the wire. It&apos;s as if nothing is moving at all from that
      standpoint, and yet the magnetic field <b>B</b> curls with the
      cumulative effect of each and every moving electron as if each of them
      were the only one that mattered. If we were to try to put this in terms of
      waves, we might think that the effect on the electrical field of the
      passage of any given electron in the circuit would <em>destructively
        interfere</em> with the effects of electrons ahead of and behind it;
      the <b>E</b> vector can&apos;t point at both the approaching <em>and
       </em> the departing charges. And yet, the interference pattern is <em>constructive</em>.
      The effect of the current as a whole is the superposition of the effects
      of the passages of the individual charges.</p>
    <p>Again, this is a point at which you would expect the writer to explain
      what is really happening; for the magician to show that the lady hasn&apos;t
      actually been sawn in half. But on this point I am going to have to leave
      both of us in suspense.</p>

    <p>I am going to set up our discussion of general relativity in a way that I
      have never seen any other writer do. You can read dozens of
      general-audience texts on relativity &mdash; maybe all of them, and the
      textbooks as well &mdash; and you won&apos;t fail to find a mention of slowed clocks
      <em>and</em> shortened measuring-sticks in any of them. But if you can be
      the first to show me a book (other than this one) that says the clocks run
      slow <em>because</em> of changes to the yardsticks, then I&apos;ll owe you
      some kind of prize. Wait, where did I make that implied assertion? Did you
      miss that part? No, you just read it where I wrote it for the first time.
      All right then, what do I mean? And do I really mean it?</p>
    <p>Before we get into that, it&apos;s important to understand that when we talked
      about clocks and yardsticks in regard to special relativity, we were
      talking about two inertial frames of reference from which observers in <em>each
       </em> judge measurements made by observers in the <em>other</em> to be
      deviating in the same way from their own standards of length and duration.
      These inertial frames of reference do not have any such measurements in
      common and never did. We haven&apos;t yet talked about what happens when an
      observer (or clock) in one reference frame is accelerated into the
      reference frame of the other so that their clocks and yardsticks can be
      compared side by side at relative rest. There&apos;s the so-called <q>Twin Paradox</q> of relativity having to do with prolonged space travel, which we
      will save for a future chapter because we will have a much more practical
      example to look at here.</p>
    <p>I should also re-emphasize that the consequences of relativity regarding
      time have to do with more than just clocks. Saying that velocity causes
      <q>clocks</q> to run more slowly is shorthand for saying that time itself
      progresses more slowly in a frame of reference that is in relative motion
      with your own.</p>
    <p>One last explanation of my intentions in this chapter before we proceed:
      in past chapters, it has been my custom to carefully set the groundwork
      for most concepts before presenting the conclusions that they are based
      on. This chapter will be an exception. If you find yourself wondering
      whether you missed the premise for something I write here, just make
      yourself a mental note to come back to it and see if it hasn&apos;t been either
      covered by the remainder of the chapter or promised in some later chapter.
      I will do my best to place signposts where appropriate.</p>
    <p>What if I told you there was a magical place where time passed just a
      little more slowly because all of the yardsticks were just a little bit
      longer there? You might tell me that I&apos;ve been reading a little too much
      Lewis Carroll. What if I told you that this <q>magical</q> place is the one
      where we live, and that in the space surrounding the Earth, time runs just
      a little bit faster and distance is measured just a little bit
      differently? If you are a particular sort of GPS engineer, you might be
      able to tell me all about it, because this is the reality you are paid to
      deal with, making sure that satellites in orbit correctly account for time
      and distance across regions where both are measured differently.</p>
    <p>As I mentioned in Chapter Twenty, I believe that the light clock is the
      key to understanding most aspects of relativity. I am are going to use an
      imaginary light clock to make my point. But first, I want to tell you
      about a type of clock that depends on a measuring stick to keep time.
      During Newton&apos;s lifetime, a French expedition to the equator found that
      its Parisian pendulum clocks ran slow by more than two minutes per day.
      Due to the bulging of the earth at the equator, their distance from the
      center of the earth was slightly greater and thus they experienced
      slightly less gravity at the same altitude. They had to trim a couple of
      millimeters from the length of the clocks&apos; pendulums to get them to tell
      time accurately at the equator. That&apos;s kind of a mind-bender, if you ask
      me.</p>
    <p>More recently, high-precision atomic clocks taken aboard air- and
      spacecraft have been shown to run faster at altitude. Synchronize two such
      clocks, fly one of them a few kilometers up in the air for a couple of
      hours, and then bring it back to compare to its mate. It will keep perfect
      time again (and indeed, will always have done so for its frame of
      reference), but it will be behind its mate now (One has to assume that the
      flight crew will experience this same difference in the flow of time as
      the clocks do, but they don&apos;t come equipped with a digital display showing
      their age to a dozen decimal places).</p>
    <p>Physicists will call this effect <q>the curvature of time</q> due to gravity
      (a phrase that I greatly dislike, by the way). Few of them will mention
      that this has anything to do with what is called the <q>curvature</q> of space,
      the way space stretches or shrinks to different length standards at
      different gravitational potentials. I will begin explaining in this
      chapter (and continue doing so in Chapter Thirty) what is meant by the
      <q>curvature</q> or
       <q>stretching</q> of space and time both individually and
      together, and what its consequences are.</p>
    <p>What I am going to tell you now may be a hard pill for you to swallow,
      because it comes without the sugar-coating of an imaginary
      four-dimensional spacetime to abstract it from your visible reality. But
      space is measured differently depending on altitude, and this is why your
      clock ticks slower down here on Earth. Find the tallest building you can,
      and go to the elevator. Are you ready to get smaller? Get in, and go to
      the top floor (just press the button labeled DRINK ME). That&apos;s it. You&apos;re
      smaller. So is the elevator and anyone who rode with you. So is any
      yardstick you took with you. I kid you not. You won&apos;t measure the
      difference, first of all because it&apos;s very, very small between ground
      level and the tallest skyscraper; and secondly, because you have no way of
      directly comparing a yardstick you took with you to the top floor to one
      you left behind at street level. But the difference is there.</p>
    <p>If you don&apos;t believe me, then ask yourself why time happens faster up
      here. If you took a light clock with you on the elevator, it&apos;s running
      faster because the distance between the mirrors is smaller. <q>No,</q> you say,
      you can&apos;t accept that? Then how about we say that you and your clock are
      the same size, but that light travels at a different speed up here?
      Whatever you want to call it, the light clock (and every other
      time-dependent process) is running faster, so it has to be one or the
      other.</p>
    <p>Not all informed writers will describe the reason for the change in the
      clock&apos;s rate of timekeeping in the same way. It&apos;s not as though physicists
      don&apos;t think about the math they use for doing calculations; but judging by
      the various descriptions one reads regarding general relativity, it seems
      as though at this level of physics most people who understand it well are
      so used to thinking mathematically that English-language descriptions seem
      too imprecise or convoluted, and as a result they have not yet come to
      agreement. And that&apos;s certainly understandable; there are inherent
      semantic problems in talking about a <q>velocity through [the dimension of] time</q> or 
      describing how <q>yardsticks change size</q> 
      and <q>distances here are not equal to distances there.</q> And what does it mean to say that your
      basis of measurement has changed if by that you also mean to say that
      everything that it measures has changed with it?<!--Come back to this and go over how this differs from other changes of basis.--></p>
    <p>Some writers will say that the speed of light is always constant as
      measured by a local observer, but that we may notice light moving more
      slowly somewhere else in a place of stronger gravity.  Physicists
      will readily agree that a clock will run slower at higher altitude and
      that spacetime is <q>curved</q> or stretched gravitationally, but it is more
      seldom that they will say that <q>space</q> is curved &mdash;  that distances
      down here are not the same as distances up there &mdash; even though they must
      recognize it to be so. And I have yet to find one physicist that would
      attribute the behavior of a clock to the curvature or stretching of
      <q>space.</q> It&apos;s the 
      <q>curvature of [space]time,</q> they will say; but you and I
      don&apos;t have to believe in a time that is anything but plain old space if we
      are ready to accept that everything is always moving
      (sub-)microscopically, as I have been hinting at for some time now by
      suggesting that everything behaves like a light clock.</p>
    <p>In developing general relativity, Einstein began with the Newtonian
      gravitational <q>curvature of time,</q> but then realized that space had to be
      curved as well in order for everything to come out right. If he had seen
      at the outset the sense in which time <em>is</em> space, and how the
      curvature of time follows from the curvature of space, he might have
      arrived at the correct theory sooner.</p>
    <p>All right then, what is meant by the <q>curvature of time</q> and
       <q>the curvature of space</q>? The most ready analogy is the curvature of the
      Earth&apos;s surface. This curvature has two consequences, only one of which is
      seen in spacetime. One consequence of the Earth&apos;s curvature is that by
      flying long distances over it, you may end up where you started. We see
      this in some sense as an effect of gravity; objects in orbit can pass
      repeatedly over the same ground location. But they do so at progressively
      later times, never returning to the same location in <q>spacetime.</q> The more
      general consequence of the curvature of any space &mdash;  whether the
      surface of a sphere or spacetime &mdash; is their complication of any sense of
      direction. If you can imagine the surface of a globe with the north pole
      at the top, imagine a tiny figure walking southward from that north pole.
      They start in a horizontal direction in the context of whatever room the
      globe is in; but by the time they reach the equator, there movement will
      be vertical. The direction of <q>south</q> is not really the same in both
      places. <q>South</q> changes direction the more southward someone goes. This is
      one way of defining the <q>curvature of space.</q></p>
    <p>The <q>curvature of time</q> is more difficult to visualize, but has the same
      sort of meaning. In some sense, the future changes direction the more into
      the future that something goes. At the moment a stone is thrown upward,
      its immediate future is upward. As time passes, the stone slows its
      ascent; its future is decreasingly <q>upward,</q> and at the point of its
      greatest height, its immediate future is momentarily right there at that
      height. Then its future begins to point downward, and does so increasingly
      until it hits bottom.</p>
    <p>But there is a slightly different way of considering the curvature of
      space that I will show you in Chapter Thirty, one related to how things
      change direction when the density of their environment changes (as with
      the light beam in Figure 14-6); there I will also show how everything that
      we associate with the curvature of time can also be attributed to this
      curvature of space. And I will make my case for a three-dimensional
      concept of spacetime in Chapter Thirty-One. For now, though, let&apos;s learn
      about general relativity in the four-dimensional context that Einstein
      gave it.</p>
    <p>General relativity is a theory of gravity. It states that matter and
      energy create curvature in the spacetime around them, and that the shape
      of spacetime is what acts on the paths that matter and energy follow.
      Whereas Newton&apos;s theory of gravity acted somewhat mysteriously over a
      distance, Einstein&apos;s theory only requires matter and energy to behave
      according to local conditions. If you have done much reading on this
      theory of gravity at all, you will no doubt have seen an illustration that
      looks something like a bowling ball on a rubber sheet (Figure 25-1). It&apos;s 
      not bad for a first pass at explaining why things follow curved paths
      around heavy masses &hellip; no, scratch that, it&apos;s just a really bad
      analogy, and I will discuss how and why in Chapter Thirty.</p>
    <h4>Geodesics</h4>
    <p>As already mentioned, the other common analogy for the curvature of
      spacetime, one which is better in some ways, is the curvature of the
      surface of the earth. There are obvious differences between spacetime and
      the Earth&apos;s surface:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> The Earth&apos;s surface has two dimensions, whereas spacetime is thought
        of as having four.</li>
      <li>Distances on the Earth&apos;s surface have to do with places rather than
        events, and are completely independent of time.</li>
      <li>The square of any distance on the Earth&apos;s surface is always positive,
        whereas the square of a spacetime interval may be negative (see Chapter
        <i>i</i><sup>2</sup>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to these differences, it seems fair to point out that no
      serious person would create a coordinate system on the Earth&apos;s surface in
      which linear distances were measured with varying magnitude, depending on
      the distance from the origin. In Chapter Seventeen, when Zeno walked out a
      certain number of rope lengths from the north pole, each of those lengths
      had the same value in radial or linear distance. The second length wasn&apos;t
      counted as being, for example, only ninety-five percent as long as the
      first. But that&apos;s exactly the sort of inconsistency one deals with in
      general relativity; and yes, we will discuss the specifics of that at some
      point in the book (Chapter Thirty).</p>
    <p>All that having been said, let&apos;s look closer at how an analogy between
      spacetime and the surface of a sphere might be instructive. In fairness to
      you as the reader I should admit that I don&apos;t expect us to get a great
      deal of mileage out of this, but if you are anywhere near as frustrated as
      I have been in trying to gain insight from the geodesic concept in
      relativity, this should at least help you feel justified. And maybe I can
      help you navigate through any material you read about it elsewhere.</p>
    <p>Long paths that seem straight to us down here on the Earth&apos;s surface
      appear curved when viewed from space, because the earth itself curves. In
      a strict sense, there is no such thing as a straight line on a perfectly
      spherical surface. Instead, what we have are <dfn>geodesics</dfn>, also
      called geodesic curves. Geodesics represent the shortest (or longest)
      paths between two points in a space. In Figure 4-6, we looked at part of a
      geodesic curve between Seattle and Berlin on a globe, the shortest path
      between the two places. The same curve, if extended all the way around the
      globe, could take us on the <em>longest</em> possible path as well, if
      we headed southwest out of Seattle to go the long way around to Berlin.
      Lines of longitude and the equator on a globe are also geodesics.</p>
    <p>The ways that the geodesic concept is invoked to explain gravity and
      relativity are often unsatisfying. When one learns about general
      relativity, an oft-stated problem is one of why a freely-falling mass will
      follow the curved path that it does under the influence of gravity. In
      short, Why do things fall down? And then the explanation offered is often
      as follows: given two events A and B, the mass will follow the nearest
      thing to a straight line between these two events in curved
      four-dimensional spacetime. This curve is a geodesic and represents the
      path of <q>maximal proper time.</q> In other words, of all the possible paths
      between A and B, the freely-falling mass will take the one which results
      in its clock having ticked the greatest number of times during the
      journey. While watching Edmund Bertschinger&apos;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MWNs7Wfk84"
        target="_blank">lecture </a>on the Einstein Field Equations at MIT, I
      took note of his remarks as an example of this approach to explaining
      relativistic gravity; I had seen it enough times previously to realize
      that I had grown uncomfortable with it. I didn&apos;t want to presuppose that a
      mass at A would in the future arrive at B; I wanted to know <em>why</em> it
      arrived at B, not what path it would take to get there. I want to know <em>why
        things fall down</em> before having a detailed explanation of their
      velocity at every moment along the way.</p>
    <p>For the same reason, I have never been satisfied with Fermat&apos;s principle
      (as illustrated in Figure 14-6), also known as the <q>principle of least time,</q> which states that when light is refracted by passing(for example)
      from air into water, it will take the path associated with the least
      amount of time between any two points on its path. Another principle
      analogous to relativity&apos;s <q>maximal proper time</q> and 
      Fermat&apos;s <q>principle of  least time</q> is the
       <q>principle of least action,</q> which was discussed at the
      end of Chapter Fourteen. All three of these principles are perhaps better
      seen as <em>consequences</em> of the physical laws governing observable
      behavior rather than being laws themselves. These principles predict
      behavior without addressing the underlying reasons for the behavior.</p>
    <p>
      In a very important sense, a geodesic path is simply one that <q>goes with the     
      flow.</q> What I mean by <q>flow</q> takes us again into the subject of differential
      equations, which we examined in Chapter Fourteen. I will repeat here what I
      wrote there: some differential equations can be visualized as a field of
      line segments (Figure 14-5, left) that each indicate a slope at any given
      point, and together these segments form several side-by-side curved paths
      (Figure 14-5, right). Each of these paths represents a particular solution
      to the equation, a solution which corresponds to a set of <q>initial conditions,</q> 
      a starting point. Choose any point on the graph as your
      starting point, and thereby determine your solution, your path and
      destination; or <i>vice versa</i>.

    <p>And, Professor Bertschinger says (in the MIT lecture referred to above),
      the formula for calculating proper time <em>does</em> imply a
      differential equation. He next goes on to discuss the Euler-Lagrange
      equations, which tie into the same Lagrangian mechanics referred to in
      Chapter Fourteen. We won&apos;t delve that deeply here.</p>
    <p>What I&apos;d like to focus on for now is that for any two-dimensional plane
      in space (and by space, I mean <q>big</q> space, like on an interplanetary
      scale), we can draw a two-dimensional map relative to our frame of
      reference of which direction an object (for instance, Zeno&apos;s lump of
      mashed potatoes) will go if allowed to fall freely from each point. We
      would need another map for each plane of space above and below the first
      one. That would be a three-dimensional system of maps, perhaps collected
      into a book. But we would also need a completely separate book for each
      possible velocity of the object/lump in question. For every possible
      velocity the lump has in (for instance) the <i>x</i> direction, any
      given planet on the map will divert the lump from its straight-line path
      by a greater or smaller angle. So now we have a line of books, each of
      which is its own three-dimensional map system. We are up to four
      dimensions now. Repeat this for possible velocities in the <i>y</i> and
      <i>z</i> directions, and we have a three-dimensional array of books, and
      therefore a six-dimensional map system. Let&apos;s hope that we can limit the
      size of this collection of books, because they and the library in which
      they are stored will need to be duplicated and modified for all the
      various points in <em>time</em> that we want to consider as well.</p>
    <p>How would we use such a system to predict the path of a given body
      through the solar system? We find the library corresponding to some
      starting time. Then we search the array of books for the volume
      corresponding to the body&apos;s initial speed and direction. Then we find the
      page of the book containing the plane the object starts in, and on that
      page we find its starting point. At that point, we find an arrow. That
      arrow may point to another location on the same page, or perhaps to
      another page. If the object is in an area where gravity is present, the
      arrow will have to give us an indication of which other <em>volume</em> to
      consult next, because gravity at that place and time will change the
      velocity of our body.</p>
    <p>Of course, such a system is highly impractical, but it does serve to show
      how much value we are getting from the mathematics of differential
      equations. Sending a space probe to Pluto requires a tremendous degree of
      accuracy, and paper maps simply won&apos;t do the trick. For every possible
      velocity we could print a book for, and for every increment of time, we
      have to consider all the times and velocities in between.</p>
    <p>Using Figure 25-4, let&apos;s consider two points in space above the earth (A
      and B, in yellow) and four different freely-falling paths from one to the
      other (numbered one through four). The green circular orbit is one of
      constant radius from the Earth, and one of constant speed but varying
      direction; there is no preferred direction in either of the orbits shown,
      meaning that an object can orbit the Earth on these paths in either the
      clockwise or counterclockwise directions. The red orbit is more eccentric,
      taking the form of an ellipse with the Earth at one focus; the nearer an
      object in this orbit passes the Earth, the faster it will go due to the
      increased gravitational attraction.</p>

    <p>It should be obvious that path number two from A to B takes more time
      than path number one; in an orbit of constant speed, it is the longer way
      around. It is less obvious that path number three is faster than path
      number one; even though its path is longer, it is one that requires a
      greater speed. This is more clearly illustrated by the animation in Figure
      25-5. Of the four paths shown from point A to point B in Figure 25-4,
      number four will involve the most proper time; it is longest and
      relatively slow. But of course a mass moving clockwise in the green orbit
      will not suddenly switch to path number four upon reaching point A, even
      though it represents a greater proper time to point B than path number
      one; it will continue along its orbit on path number one, reaching point B
      at its particular pace. A mass in the red orbit passing through point A
      will reach point B in more or less time than one taking path number one,
      depending on whether it goes clockwise on path number four or
      counterclockwise on path number three. Remember that spacetime intervals
      and proper times are measurements between events, not between points in
      space. Four masses passing through point A at the same time, each on one
      of the numbered paths, will reach point B at four different times, and
      thus at four different events.</p>
    <p>When invoking the principle of maximal proper time, we specify two
      events, not two points, and further specify that a mass will fall freely
      between events A and B with no forces acting on it, unless one counts
      gravity. Having done that, we have already implicitly chosen the
      trajectory that the mass must be on by the time it reaches event A, and
      the path it must take to B, given the laws of gravity. There is no freedom
      of choice between multiple paths with varying proper times, and no
      guesswork incumbent on the mass. <q>Maximal proper time</q> is interesting, in
      that it is another way of saying <q>freely falling,</q> but seems to explain
      precisely nothing about <em>why things fall down</em>, and any suggestion
      to the contrary seems like a cheap mentalist&apos;s trick, ascribing something
      semi-mystical to a process that is fully deterministic: <q>Guess any number between one and nine. Multiply it by three. Add three to it. Multiply by three again. Add the digits together.</q> Then, after dramatically holding an
      envelope to their forehead, the mentalist opens it and triumphantly
      produces the number nine.</p>
    <p>The real answer about why things fall freely on curved paths, and why
      they fall down, really depends on what is often called the <em>curvature
        of time</em>, which I have seen explained nowhere more clearly than I
      have done above. Put another way, more metaphorically than mathematically,
      every object follows its particular compass into the future, and gravity
      acts on the future-pointing compasses of any objects nearby to make them
      point more in the direction of the source of gravity. But time is an
      abstraction that I prefer not to invoke unless absolutely necessary, so in
      Chapter Thirty I will put all of this in terms of the curvature of space,
      which causes light to bend its path over a varying gravitational potential
      for the same reasons its path bends when it strikes a boundary between air
      and water; for reasons similar to the path of a truck being diverted when
      it hits a patch of deep mud on one side. <q>Least time</q>
       or <q>maximal aging</q> over such paths are effects, not causes.</p>
    <p>I am not quite sure what to think about the following comments by Stephen
      Hawking on the subject of geodesics in spacetime:
   </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In general relativity, bodies always follow straight lines in
        four-dimensional space-time, but they nevertheless appear to us to move
        along curved paths in our three-dimensional space. (This is rather like
        watching an airplane flying over hilly ground. Although it follows a
        straight line in three-dimensional space, its shadow follows a curved
        path on the two-dimensional ground.)<!-- BHT, p. 30 --></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It seems to make sense the first time you read it, but then it starts to
      look like nonsense; like how <q>everything happens for a reason</q> sounds deep
      until you give it any thought at all. As a metaphor, we are given a
      straight path in a relatively flat higher dimension being projected onto a
      very curvy lower-dimensional surface. Something seems off in that respect;
      if something is curved in two dimensions, it&apos;s still curved in three. And
      since to most of us a <q>straight</q> path means
       <q>as short as possible,</q> it
      seems we are expected to believe that a meandering path in space plus the
      <em>longest</em> possible interval of time  (<q>maximal aging</q>) is somehow
      the shortest possible path in something called spacetime.</p>
    <p>In order to avoid confusing causes with effects, longest with shortest,
      and geodesic with straight, it just seems more sensible to accept that
      everything can curve, and that&apos;s okay if we can understand the reasons for
      it. We don&apos;t need to suppose that all four curved paths shown in Figure
      25-4 have some four-dimensional context in which they are all straight.
      But we should expect to be able to construct a diagram like Figure 14-5
      showing how neighboring paths relate to one another. And by <q>neighboring</q>
      paths, we mean not only those that cross nearby points at similar times,
      but those that do so with similar velocities. In Figure 25-4, for example,
      paths 1 and 4 might be considered to cross point A at the same time, but
      at greatly different velocities. There ought to be a chart of some
      differential equation like the one in Figure 14-5 on which we will find
      both path 1 and path 4 and all of the paths corresponding to all the
      velocities in between. In some sense, there could be such a chart, but it
      would require at least four dimensions. We would need two dimensions for
      the graph of an object&apos;s position in space, another dimension to show how
      that position changes over time, and at least a fourth to show how that
      position&apos;s evolution over time is influenced by its initial velocity (the
      number of additional dimensions required in the chart would be the number
      of dimensions we want to account for velocity in, between one and three).
      The green orbit could be represented by a circular helix in three
      dimensions (Figure 25-5), and as we changed the fourth dimension of the
      graph, that helix could stretch in one direction of space and shrink in
      another to represent the red orbit. On the time axis, the helix would
      periodically stretch and compress to show the periods of slow and fast
      motion in the eccentric orbit.</p>

    <p>In place of a multi-dimensional chart, we have a set of differential
      equations which tell us all of the ways in which such a chart would be
      constructed. These are called the Einstein field equations, and they are
      the mathematical expression of the general theory of relativity.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>In Equation 25-1, one equation stands in for many. The Greek letters mu
      and nu (<i>&mu;</i>,<i>&nu;</i>) stand in for each of the four dimensions of
      spacetime, and each unique combination of two of these four dimensions
      gives us a total of sixteen equations.  On the left-hand side, we
      have tensor terms <i>R<sub>&mu;</sub></i><sub><i>&nu;</i></sub> and g<i><sub>&mu;</sub></i><sub><i>&nu;
       </i> </sub>representing the curvature and metric of spacetime, as
      touched on in Chapter Seventeen; on the left we have the energy-momentum
      tensor <i>T<sub>&mu;</sub></i><sub><i>&nu;</i></sub>, which contains
      information about the density and flow of mass and energy. And the
      equality sign in the middle completes the idea that the curvature of
      spacetime is a consequence of mass/energy flow/density.
      <!--give an example of of the 16 equations. Choose a pair of indices.--></p>
    <p>What makes these equations differential is that the curvature tensor<i>
        R</i><i><i><sub>&mu;</sub></i><sub><i>&nu;</i></sub></i> is calculated
      from derivatives of the metric tensor <i>g</i><i><sub>&mu;</sub></i><sub><i>&nu;</i></sub>.
      This being the case, one need only specify the metric tensor to determine
      the rest of the left-hand side, and thus determine the right-hand side as
      well. Being differential equations, the Einstein field equations have not
      one solution, but many, depending on the conditions being described. There
      is of course the trivial solution in which spacetime is flat and the
      associated volume of space is empty of energy or mass. In such conditions,
      no freely-falling objects change their speed or direction. We will discuss
      the simplest of the non-trivial solutions, the Schwarzschild solution, in
      terms of its associated metric tensor in Chapter Thirty.</p>

    <h3 id="Fourier">Chapter Twenty-Six<br>
      Achilles and the Tortoise (II) </h3>
    <p>As I write this, it feels as though the book is reaching a midpoint of
      some kind, where we are in large part done with figuring out the
      comparatively concrete and deterministic world of relativity and classical
      mechanics, and we begin a serious foray into the more abstract domain of
      quantum mechanics. But I know that as we proceed, we will at several
      points need to go re-examine several previously-covered subjects; quantum
      mechanics will require us to call into question many things we thought
      were well-understood. We still have many fascinating surprises in store,
      and the most mind-bending are yet to come. This chapter will cover math
      concepts which will be absolutely essential for a deep understanding of
      quantum mechanics, and most of these will have to do with waves.</p>
    <p>I have given this chapter a title which may be misleading; we return now
      not to the story of Achilles and the Tortoise, but to the idea that a
      single thing can be thought of as being composed of infinitely many parts.
      We looked at this idea from the other side in Chapter Fifteen, in which it
      was shown that an infinite number of increasingly small parts could
      comprise a finite whole. In that chapter, we saw that the sine and cosine
      functions of <i>x</i> could be rewritten as the sum of an infinite
      series of increasingly small fractions of increasing powers of <i>x</i>.
      Though this wasn&apos;t pointed out at the time, these series are examples of
      what are called <dfn>Taylor series</dfn>. We call a function that adds
      various powers of <i>x</i> a <em>polynomial</em> function. If each
      power of <i>x</i> is thought of as being a function in its own right,
      any polynomial function, including a Taylor series, could be considered a
      <em>superposition</em> of functions which are powers of <i>x</i>. The
      idea behind the Taylor series in particular is that non-polynomial
      functions, such as sin(<i>x</i>), cos(<i>x</i>), and e<i><sup>x</sup></i>
      can all be approximated by a superposition of polynomial functions as
      well. Not only that, but if we are allowed an infinite number of
      components in this sum of terms, then the series of polynomials can give a
      <em>precise</em> representation of the functions they are modeling (as
      seen in Equations 15-6 through 15-8).</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>This is all just a recap of what we saw in Chapter Fifteen. Grant
      Sanderson has a great video on Taylor series here if you&apos;d like to deepen
      your understanding: <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/taylor-series"

        target="_blank">https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/taylor-series</a> .
      In the video, it becomes clear, for instance, why the factorial function
      appears in the Taylor series.</p>
    <p>What we will look at next is what sorts of functions we can make by
      combining sine and cosine functions into various superpositions; and the
      answer is that we can get any sort of function we can imagine. In other
      words, any function of <i>x</i>, <em>including</em> functions that
      aren&apos;t even continuous, can be expressed as the combination of many, or
      possibly infinitely many, sine and cosine functions. The mathematics of
      how simple and complex things can be added up and broken down into one
      another are essential for understanding quantum mechanics.</p>
    <p>I have spent a fair amount of time tinkering with simple electronic
      circuits and sound synthesizers. One of my childhood kit projects was a
      circuit that produced a tone in a small speaker. The circuit included a
      knob that I could turn to change the pitch of the tone. I don&apos;t know
      whether the design of the circuit allowed me to turn the knob so that the
      tone went to the bottom of the frequency range of human hearing or whether
      I had to experiment with changing out some of the parts in the circuit,
      but I eventually was able to dial the frequency down far enough so that
      instead of a tone, the circuit produced a rapid succession of evenly-timed
      clicks. Click-click-click-click-click-click. As the voltage in one part of
      the circuit switched on, current would flow around a magnet attached to
      the speaker, which was more or less a shallow-angled cone of thick paper.
      The magnet would react to the magnetic field being induced in the coil by
      pushing the speaker out. A fraction of a second later, the voltage in that
      part of the circuit would be cut off, and the speaker would drop back down
      again. Click. (To run a simulation of this in a web browser, go to the
      link in Figure 26-1, and adjust the settings as shown.)</p>

    <p>If I slowly turned the frequency back up again, that series of clicks
      began to take on the characteristics of a low tone. The on-and-off pattern
      of the voltage in the circuit was like the square wave shown in Figure
      26-1. Square waves sound <q>noisy</q> at low frequencies; they are more like
      the buzz of a motorcycle than the pure tone made by blowing into a large
      bottle. Unlike sine waves, square waves contain many overtones, which are
      other frequencies superimposed over the main or fundamental frequency.
      Just how these secondary frequencies relate to the fundamental, and how
      signal can emerge from noise, is the focus of the rest of this chapter.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier was
      working on a mathematical description for the diffusion of heat. 
      What he discovered along the way was much deeper (and would, along with
      the Schr&ouml;dinger wave equation which is very much like the heat diffusion
      equation, be of fundamental importance in quantum mechanics).  The
      wave function in Figure 26-1 is a discontinuous function. It has two
      values which alternate of the range of the function, and no places in the
      range where the function has any of the values in-between. But this wave
      function can nevertheless be expressed as the sum of an infinite series of
      smooth, continuous sine waves superimposed on one another; we call such a
      series a <dfn>Fourier series</dfn>. A Fourier series can represent a
      periodic function of any sort as the weighted sum of sine waves.

    <p>In Figure 26-2 we see a square wave being modeled by one or more
      sinusoidal waves. At the top, we see a single sine wave alongside the
      square wave. This sine wave has the same frequency, phase and amplitude as
      the square wave it makes a reasonable approximation of. We&apos;ll call this
      sine wave F<sub>1</sub>. It doesn&apos;t matter here whether this wave
      represents air pressure or the voltage in an electrical circuit; a wave is
      a wave, and waves can be superimposed on one another to interfere either
      constructively or destructively; in other words, their amplitudes can
      either add together or cancel out as described in Chapter Twelve. To the
      wave F<sub>1 </sub>we will add another wave F<sub>2</sub>, which has a
      smaller amplitude and twice the frequency. And we will line it up
      phase-wise with F<sub>1</sub> so that wherever and whenever F<sub>1</sub>
      has zero amplitude, F<sub>2</sub> will have zero amplitude as well. We can
      see the results of this addition in the second-topmost part of Figure
      26-2. The superposition of F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> matches the
      square waveform just a little bit better. And on we go, adding a third and
      a fourth wave with just the right frequencies, phases, and amplitudes as
      shown in the remaining parts of the diagram. These are the first four
      waves in the infinite series called the Fourier series; each successive
      wave in the series is a little smaller in amplitude and higher in
      frequency. Fourier&apos;s theory allows us to calculate the amplitude, phase
      and frequency for each term in the infinite series, but in practice, we
      just add the number of terms that are <q>good enough</q> for our purposes.</p>
    <p>Figure 26-3 (above) shows the same additive process in a slightly
      different way. Each successive wave is represented by a <dfn>phasor</dfn> (a
      rotating vector; see Chapter <i>i</i>) of decreasing amplitude and
      increasing frequency.</p>

    <p>Figure 26-4 is an animation showing the first <em>six</em> sinusoidal
      waves in a similar Fourier series. Accompanying it are three still images
      showing various frames from the animation. The wave <i>s</i> as a
      function of <i>x</i> is the sum of six components s<sub>1</sub> through
      s<sub>6</sub>. These six waves are shown one on top of the other in faint
      blue in Figure 26-4a. In the three-dimensional perspective of Figure
      26-4b, they are shown one behind the other, or at increasing distances
      along a frequency spectrum. Their various amplitudes are represented along
      a frequency axis (blue) both there and in Figure 26-4c. The vertical bars
      in Figure 26-4c could be interpreted as being square in shape, just like
      the wave function in the <i>x</i> domain (Figure 26-1), but in the <i>f</i>
      (frequency) domain they are of various heights (amplitudes) and infinitely
      narrow. If you are confused by my use of the word <q>domain</q> here, it refers
      to the basis of the graph; a graph in the position (<i>x</i>) domain
      shows graphs as a function of position, and a graph in the time domain
      shows output values as a function of time (and since waves generally do
      vary with time, there would be a meaningful graph of amplitude over time
      which we haven&apos;t shown here that would look very similar to Figure 26-4a).
      So in the frequency domain of Figure 26-4c, we have amplitudes of various
      waves as a function of their frequency.</p>
    <p>Maybe you have seen this before, but I still find it astonishing. Each of
      the <q>clicks</q> in an electronic circuit can add up over time with others to
      produce a tone (Figure 26-1). But this series of clicks is in turn <em>composed
        of</em> any number of tones in simultaneous superposition (Figure
      26-4). Something about that reminds me of zooming in on a fractal image to
      find the same pattern repeating at all possible scales. But it gets even
      more astonishing when we make the transition from the Fourier <em>series</em>,
      which concerns periodically repeating functions, to the Fourier <dfn>transform</dfn>,
      which is the math that would describe a single click. Counterintuitively,
      though the <em>series</em> of periodic clicks is composed of an infinite
      number of evenly-spaced frequencies, a <em>single</em> click when
      decomposed into an infinite series of sine waves has frequency components
      with continuous non-zero amplitude <em>in between and in
        addition to</em> the frequencies for any equivalent periodic function.
      Before we go there, however, we ought to broaden our understanding of
      waves and periodic functions. 
   </p>
    <h4>Complex waves</h4>
    <p>Up until now, we have considered the real-valued wave functions sine and
      cosine, and we have seen the complex-number definitions of both of these
      functions, but we haven&apos;t really considered complex-valued wave functions
      <i>per se</i>. To be able to follow the math of quantum mechanics, we&apos;ll
      need to get really comfortable with complex wave functions.  In
      Chapter <i>i</i>, we looked at Euler&apos;s Formula, which defines a
      relationship between the sine and cosine functions and an exponent of the
      number <i>e</i>:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>e<sup>ix</sup></i> = sin <i>x</i> + <i>i</i> cos <i>x</i></p>
      <b>Equation i-2</b> (repeated). <span class="equation_description">Euler&apos;s 
      formula.</span></blockquote>
    <p>The function <i>e<sup>ix</sup></i> defines a wave that repeats every
      2&pi; values of <i>x</i> with maximum and minimum values of 1 and -1. For
      every value of <i>x</i>, the function has a real-valued part, sin(<i>x</i>),
      and an imaginary part, cos(<i>x</i>).</p>
    <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/799px-Sinus_und_Cosinus_am_Einheitskreis.gif"

        style="max-height: 350px;"></p>
    <blockquote> <b>Figure 5-5</b> (repeated). The
      sine wave and cosine wave as a rotation in the complex plane.</blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <p>If we want to change the periodicity of the wave, we can include a factor
      <i>k</i> in the exponent of  <i>e</i>. The function <i>e<sup>ikx</sup></i>
      repeats every 2&pi;/<i>k</i> values of <i>x</i>, meaning that over 2&pi;
      units of distance, there will be <i>k</i> cycles of the
      function. We call <i>k</i> the <dfn>wavenumber</dfn> of the wave
      function, referring not to sequentially-numbered wave crests, but to the
      density of the crests over space.</p>
    <p>So far, our wave function does not change over time as waves do; we need
      to make it a function of time as well as position. The function <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><sup>(</sup><i><sup>kx-&omega;t</sup></i><sup>)</sup><i><sup>
        </sup></i> will do nicely. The factor <i>&omega;</i> is called the angular
      frequency of the wave function; it is equal to 2&pi; times the frequency,
      meaning that the wave cycle will repeat <i>&omega;</i> times every 2&pi; units
      of time (seconds).</p>

      of a complex-valued wave function varying over <i>x</i> with time. We

      horizontal plane in blue, the imaginary part in the vertical plane to the
      right in red, and the complex plane perpendicular to both of these,

    <p>In a complex-valued wave function, we have two different sets of <q>crests</q>
      and <q>troughs:</q> those belonging to the real part and those belonging to the
      imaginary part. Rather than coinciding, these are 90 degrees out of phase,
      and as a result the magnitude of the function is constant (it remains a
      constant distance from the <i>x</i> axis, circling it) but changing its
      direction.</p>
    <p>With our wave function now depending on just <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>,
      and not <i>y</i> or <i>z</i>, we have the definition of what is
      called a <dfn>plane wave</dfn> propagating in the <i>x</i> direction.
      Each <q>plane</q> of the wave has a single <i>x</i> value and extends

    <p>Plane waves in air can be generated by the movement of a large flat

    <p>Let&apos;s have a look at all the variables in a wave function and how they
      relate. We haven&apos;t talked about the wavelength &lambda;, because it can be
      inferred from wavenumber <i>k</i>: <i>&lambda;</i> = 2&pi;/<i>k</i>
      and vice versa (<i>k</i> = 2&pi;/<i>&lambda;</i> ). Here&apos;s a handy chart to see
      how it all fits together:</p>

    <p>I&apos;d like to call attention to the barred lambda symbol at the lower right,
      ƛ. This quantity is the wavelength <i>&lambda;</i> divided by 2&pi;. When dealing
      with periodic phenomena it often becomes convenient to define quantities
      as a ratio with 2&pi;. We&apos;ll see this again in the following chapter.</p>
    <h4>Phase velocity and group velocity</h4>
    <p>An important thing that we haven&apos;t touched on yet is the <em>velocity</em> of
      our waves. You may have already learned that velocity <i>v</i> is the
      product of the frequency <i>f</i> and the wavelength <i>&lambda;</i>: <i>v
        = f&lambda;.</i> We call this the <dfn>phase velocity</dfn> of a wave,
      because it&apos;s the speed of the wave&apos;s crests and troughs. There is an
      equivalent calculation of the phase velocity, which is <i>v =</i> <i><i>&omega;</i>/k</i>.
      This is why we ended up with two independent <q>frequencies</q> <i><i>&omega;</i>
     </i> and <i>k</i> in <i>e<sup>i</sup></i><sup>(</sup><i><sup>kx-</sup></i><sup><i>&omega;t</i>)</sup>
      : one has to do with time and the other with space, and you need both to
      determine a velocity. When the <i><i>&omega;</i>/k</i> ratio
      changes, so does the phase velocity; some waves travel faster than others.
      We see this, for instance, on the surface of deep water, with longer waves
      traveling more slowly.</p>

        Commons</a>.</blockquote>
    <p>This is illustrated in Figure 26-9 above, which is the product of two
      sine waves, one longer and one shorter. Watch the red square associated
      with a shorter wavelength move at a greater speed than the green dots at
      the troughs of the longer wavelength. Here is where our footing gets
      really slippery. Because when we add two waves of different frequencies
      and velocities, what is most apparent to us is not the two waves that make
      up that sum, but a slightly different pair of waves that multiply together
      as a product. I know that sounds very confusing, so we&apos;ll go over that in
      some detail. </p>
    <p>Let&apos;s say that I have two wave functions, &theta;(<i>x,t</i>) and &phi;(<i>x,t</i>).
      We define &theta; as cos(5.5<i>x</i> - 20.75<i>t</i>) and &phi; as cos(4.5<i>x</i>
      - 19.25<i>t</i>). Each of them has a phase velocity that moves to the
      right, and these velocities aren&apos;t quite the same. If we add them together
      to make a new wave function &psi; = &theta; + &phi; = cos(5.5<i>x</i> - 20.75<i>t</i>
      + cos(4.5<i>x</i> - 19.25<i>t</i>), we get a wave that looks a lot
      like Figure 26-9. You might start to think that the wavelength between the
      blue wave crests is the wavelength of one of the waves we added, either &theta;
      or &phi;, and that the distance between the green dots is the wavelength of
      the other one. But that isn&apos;t how it works at all. There are about five
      crests between any given pair of green dots at any time, and there really
      isn&apos;t that much difference between the frequencies of our two waves. &theta; has
      a wavenumber <i>k</i> of 5.5 and &phi; has <i>k</i>=4.5. &theta; has an
      angular frequency <i>&omega;</i>of 20.75 and &phi; has <i>&omega;</i>=19.25. They&apos;re
      nowhere near a five-to-one ratio. 
   </p>
    <p>So we need to introduce a whole new concept now. Yes, there is a wave
      function that has the frequency and velocity of the blue wave crests; this
      is sometimes called the <dfn>carrier wave</dfn>. And yes, there is another
      one that crosses the x axis where the green dots are; this is sometimes
      called the <dfn>envelope wave.</dfn> But neither of these quite match up
      with either of the waves we added together. We&apos;ll see in a moment how
      these two pairs of waves relate to one another. We still call the movement
      of the blue wave crests in Figure 26-9 the phase velocity of the function
      &psi;. We call the movement of the longer sinusoidal shape governing the
      amplitudes of the individual crests, the envelope wave that goes to zero
      at each the green dots, the <em>group velocity</em> of the function &psi;.

    <h4>Wave packets (less is more)</h4>
    <p>So far we have made waves change shape and travel in groups. We have one
      final trick to accomplish, and that&apos;s to produce a single wave or group of
      waves that isn&apos;t preceded or followed by another.  We call such a
      thing a <dfn>wave packet</dfn>, and unlike wave patterns that repeat
      endlessly, a wave packet is not just the sum of several sinusoidal waves;
      it is the sum of an infinite series of waves. We can create wave behavior
      that is somewhat like a single group with a finite sum, but to eliminate
      all amplitudes outside the group requires an infinite series.</p>

    <p>In Figure 26-13, we can see that with the addition of each
      carefully-chosen wave, the amplitude of the composite wave becomes more
      concentrated in a single place. If we were to set each of these wave in
      motion, giving the higher-frequency waves a higher phase velocity, we
      could produce a traveling wave packet as shown in Figure 26-14.</p>

    <h4>Fourier transforms</h4>
    <p>Now let&apos;s talk about the mathematics of analyzing an infinite series of
      wave functions. Take another look at Figure 26-4b in which we have a
      periodic wave function over the <i>x</i> domain (position) represented
      by just six discrete amplitudes in the <i>f</i> domain (frequency). To
      build a wave packet, there will be a continuous range of frequencies
      making up the final result, which means that the graph on the <i>f</i>
      domain will also be a curve. What gives us a map from the curve on the <i>x</i>
      domain to the curve on the <i>f</i> domain are the set of equations
      known as <dfn>Fourier transforms</dfn>. Using these, we can switch the
      basis of our wave function and look at it in terms of position, frequency
      or wavenumber.</p>
    <p>What these equations tell us about the relationship between position and
      frequency (or wavenumber) is that they are (for want of a better term) <em>holistic</em>.
      To get the amplitude for a single value of one quantity, you must perform
      a calculation over the entire range of the other. To find out the
      amplitude for the sine wave having five cycles per unit of distance (<i>k</i>=5),
      for instance, we can take the position-based function &psi;(<i>x</i>) and
      split it into infinitesimally narrow vertical areas, as shown in Figure
      15-1 below.</p>

    <p>Then we multiply each of these infinitely-numbered pieces times  <i>e</i><sup>-5<i>ix</i></sup>/√(2&pi;)
      and add them together.  For wavenumber five-and-a-half, we do the
      same, but multiplying each piece by  <i>e</i><sup>-5.5<i>ix</i></sup>/√(2&pi;). 
      Some pieces will be positive, some will be negative, and some will be
      zero, which means that our end result will usually be a finite number.
      This is the meaning of the Fourier transform shown in Equation 26-3:</p>

    <p>Conversely, if we know the wavenumber distribution of a composite wave
      function, we can calculate its amplitude as a function of position:</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Each of these wave functions in the <i>x</i> or <i>k</i> domain thus
      contains the same information expressed on a different basis.</p>
    <h4>Fourier conjugates</h4>
    <p>There&apos;s something very significant about the relationship between the
      position domain <i>x</i> and the frequency domains <i>f</i> and <i>k
     </i> that I want to emphasize, because it becomes very important
      in the context of quantum mechanics. Let&apos;s look at the ways that the
      curves in the x and k domains compare in several different situations.
      First we start with a very simple function in the <i>k</i> domain, a
      single spatial frequency with a fixed amplitude, and then see how it looks
      in terms of amplitudes of <i>x</i>. Let&apos;s say that <i>k</i> is equal
      to seven and the amplitude for that frequency is two, so our wave function
      &phi;(<i>k</i>) is sort of strange. At <i>k</i>=7 it has a value of
      2/√(2&pi;), which is about 0.79, and everywhere else it is zero. Being
      discontinuous, there doesn&apos;t seem to be an elegant way to write that
      function mathematically, but it&apos;s simple enough to draw its graph (Figure
      26-16).  The corresponding function in the x domain is our familiar <i>e<sup>ikx</sup></i>
      multiplied by amplitude <i>A</i>: <i>A</i><i>e<sup>ikx</sup></i> .
      In this case, ψ(<i>x</i>)= 2 <i>e</i><sup><i>i</i>7<i>x</i></sup> =
      2cos(7<i>x</i>) + 2<i>i</i> sin(7<i>x</i>).  (Figure 26-17). 
   </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/Fig26-16.png" style="max-height: 300px;">

        the <i>x</i> domain, ψ(<i>x</i>)= 2 <i>e</i><sup><i>i</i>7<i>x</i></sup>

        of ψ(<i>x</i>) is shown.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We should keep in mind that complex-valued simple sine functions change
      in direction but not in amplitude, as seen in Figure 12-7. Though the
      real-valued graph in Figure 26-17 oscillates up and down, the magnitude of
      the function would be a horizontal line at the value 2.</p>
    <p>Conversely, if we had an infinitely narrow <q>wave packet</q> with an
      amplitude of 2/√(2&pi;) at the position <i>x</i>=7, its graph in the <i>x</i>
      domain would be as shown in Figure 26-16. The frequency distribution of
      the waves needed to build this wave packet would be as shown in Figure
      26-17. This is a very surprising result, but if you add up waves of every
      possible wavenumber <i>k</i>, give them an amplitude of two, and set
      each of them at the correct phase given by &phi;(<i>k</i>) = 2 <i>e</i><sup><i>i</i>7</sup><i><sup>k</sup>,
     </i> then you get the stationary wave packet at <i>x</i>=7.</p>
    <p>It turns out that the more concentrated that the wave function is in the
      position domain (<i>x</i>), the more widely-distributed it is over
      either of the frequency domains (<i>f</i> or <i>k</i> or <i>&omega;</i>),
      and vice versa. In the previous two examples, we had one aspect of the
      wavefunction, either position or frequency, defined with infinite
      precision; the result was that the other aspect became distributed over a
      continuous and infinite range. We call the relationship between <i>x</i>
      and <i>k</i> a <dfn>Fourier conjugate</dfn> relationship.</p>
    <p>Our wave functions need not be so dramatically different in their
      distributions. If, instead of the precise function shown in Figure 26-16,
      we choose something broader, its Fourier transform becomes less uniform.
      In Figure 26-18 it is shown that like position <i>x</i>, the time
      variable <i>t</i> also has a Fourier conjugate relationship with one of
      the frequency variables, in this case <i>&omega;</i>. The graphs on the left
      are a function of time <i>t</i> and are the <q>clicks</q> referred to much
      earlier in this chapter. To their right are their Fourier transforms in
      the <i>&omega;</i> domain, their angular frequency distributions.</p>

    <p>
      With a broader range of values on the left (comparing Figure 26-16 to the
    left side of Figure 26-18), the conjugate quantity represented in the
    Fourier transform on the right shows a more concentrated distribution.
    Perhaps you are wondering where some sort of balance can be reached, if the
    distribution of one quantity can be fine-tuned so that the distribution of
    its conjugate quantity is equal. This balance is found in what is called a <dfn>Gaussian
      distribution</dfn> (Yes, it&apos;s named for that same Gauss mentioned in
    Chapters Twelve and Seventeen).

    </blockquote>
    <p>The wave packet in Figure 26-19 has just such a distribution. If we take
      into account that this is a complex-valued function with imaginary parts
      that fill the gaps where the real part goes to zero and vice versa, then
      the magnitude of this wave function is a bell-shaped curve. The Fourier
      transform of a Gaussian function is another Gaussian function. 
   </p>
    <p>Gaussian distributions are something you will read about in statistics.
      If you gather enough sample measurements in two variables, you will find
      that the distribution of values over one variable for a fixed value of
      another variable will look like a bell curve. For example, measure the
      heights of all students in the senior class of some high school, and you
      will find that most of them have a height near some middle value and
      relatively few numbers of students who are much taller or shorter. But
      it&apos;s more specific than that; the rate at which the number of students
      falls off as you consider heights that are further from the center value
      is what makes this Gaussian distribution special.</p>
    <h4>Deep thoughts</h4>
    <p>What I called the <q>very surprising result</q> of adding up the infinite
      waves in the <i>k</i> domain of Figure 26-17 to get a single bump in
      the <i>x</i> domain of Figure 26-16 is actually more than that; it&apos;s 
      magic. If we extend Fourier&apos;s math to get time-variant results in more
      than one dimension, we can create a sudden spike in amplitude that seems
      to come out of nowhere. It&apos;s no less than a formula for un-exploding a
      bomb (Chapter Eighteen), or for making the fallen lump of mashed potatoes
      (Figure 6-2) suddenly pop off of the truck bed (Chapter Eighteen), in much
      the same way that we might sync up the firing of an infinite number of
      pistols (Figure 7-5) or the ringing of a bells in an infinite number of
      towers (Figure 7-9).  The Fourier transform is the Infinite
      Improbability Equation, the instructions for running the thermodynamic
      clock backwards. Fourier did get there by groping after a heat diffusion
      equation, after all. The devil is in the details, of course; it&apos;s all very
      well to have the specifications for an infinite number of wave sources,
      but having the resources to make and control them is another matter.</p>
    <p>One of Zeno&apos;s lesser-known paradoxes is sometimes referred to as the
      <q>paradox of the grain of millet,</q> which was very nearly lost to history.
      <!-- href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#GraMil"
        --> What remains of it is unclear and from secondary (or even more
      distant) sources. We have only this from Aristotle:  <q>&hellip; Zeno&apos;s reasoning is false when he argues that there is no part of the millet that does not make a sound; for there is no reason why any part should not in any length of time fail to move the air that the whole bushel moves in falling.</q>
      Aristotle&apos;s use of multiple negatives here is confusing, but the core
      question seems to be this: If a whole bushel&apos;s measure of grains falls to
      the floor, does each grain make a sound? Assuming that no one can hear the
      fall of a single grain, can <q>something</q> emerge from the superposition of a
      thousand <q>nothings?</q>  I don&apos;t find the argument interesting in and of
      itself, but I do like the way it frames some of the questions central to
      this chapter.</p>
    <p>A single pulse of voltage in an electrical circuit, a single tick on a
      Geiger counter has no frequency. Or perhaps <em>all</em> the
      frequencies, just not a specific one. Tone is what emerges from a series
      of ticks over time. A single push on a charged mass produces a pulse, an
      electromagnetic wave signaling to the universe that something somewhere
      has been accelerated. This wave has no frequency, and the photons
      associated with it must have frequencies of their own, but not necessarily
      the same ones. If we push electrons up and down an antenna on a regularly
      repeating basis, though, a signal emerges from all the noise, and there is
      a broadcast frequency to speak of.   </p>
    <p>At the point of origin, the signal is strong, and it&apos;s easy to infer it
      over the background noise of the electromagnetic field. But the further
      out one goes, the more the photon spray thins out, and the less often our
      receiving antenna will be hit. The photons are detected with less . .
      .  frequency; but that&apos;s not the right word in this case. Each
      individual photon has the same frequency it started with at the origin;
      their incidence per square meter per second just drops with increasing
      distance. And they each carry the same <q>amplitude</q> throughout their
      journey in terms of their energy, and yet in aggregate that energy falls
      off with distance as well. As a result, the signal starts to fade. Radios
      are still a thing, right? Turn one on and listen to a broadcast that&apos;s 
      weak enough that it becomes noisy. The same principle applies to the
      digital sound we hear on the internet, but it&apos;s been a few years since
      low-bandwidth noise was a common problem. In either case, what happens is
      that the signal arrives <em>incomplete</em>. In low-bandwidth or
      low-power broadcasts, there aren&apos;t enough sound samples per second to
      reliably reproduce the sound wave being represented. Look again at Figure
      15-1 (repeated above) and ask yourself how reliably you would be able to
      reconstruct those curves from the vertical bars underneath them if some
      large percentage of the bars were to go missing.</p>

    <p>Quantum mechanics (QM) is a notoriously difficult subject to explain. One
      hundred years after it began to take shape mathematically, theoretical
      physicists continue to debate and speculate over its meaning. Unlike
      relativity, which began with a logical conclusion and acquired its
      formulas later, QM is a system of equations still in search of a
      philosophy. Quantum physics is an area I am less familiar with than
      relativity; though I have read many popular-science articles and books on
      it (perhaps more than I ought to have) I have only begun to grasp the
      mathematics of it. Still, I have found it interesting enough to have
      developed some thoughts of my own on it, and I will share the more
      speculative of these thoughts at this book&apos;s conclusion. In this chapter I
      will give an overview of the history of QM, the ideas that are central to
      it, and its most surprising results. I will try to avoid what I see as an
      almost ritual recitation of <q>quantum weirdness</q> in many other books.</p>
    <p>My assumption is that if you are reading this, you are likely to have
      some background in what will follow here. But if not, let&apos;s begin by
      saying that quantum mechanics deals with very small things; these things
      are so small that it becomes hard to find them and measure them without
      disturbing them. We will call this the <q>measurement problem,</q> and will
      discuss it further. But there are deeper questions raised in QM. Objects
      have properties that we take for granted at the large scale, such as
      position, momentum, and energy; but the meaning of these properties
      changes at the quantum scale, and it isn&apos;t clear why. It only <em>begins
     </em> to become clear once we take a close look at some very interesting
      math, and for this reason I won&apos;t make any apologies for including that
      math in my explanations. Again, the <em>math</em> of QM is all of its
      <q>meaning</q> that we have, at least for most of its history.</p>
    <h4>Philosophy</h4>
    <p>My current favorite book on QM is <cite>Beyond Weird</cite> by Philip Ball.
      Even after all I have read on the subject, this book was so informative
      and thought-provoking that I took seven pages of notes on my first
      reading. By the time I got a dozen or so pages in, it became clear that
      not only is the philosophy of QM still evolving, but that even the
      terminology we might use to talk about its meaning still seems to be
      lacking. Of course we can talk precisely (even if the language seems
      obscure to the novice) about the <em>epistemic</em> meaning of the
      mathematics; we can say that such-and-such function represents the
      statistical likelihoods of some property of a particle being measured as
      one value in comparison to the likelihood of other values. But the <em>ontic
       </em> meaning of the calculations &mdash; what we can justifiably say about the
      properties of physical reality in-between the times that these properties
      are being measured &mdash; is a little more slippery. QM has developed into a
      system of incredible predictive power, Ball writes, but  <q>No one tells you that it lacks justification beyond the mere (and obviously important) fact that it works.</q> Unlike the theories that preceded it, 
      QM  <q>is not so much a theory that one can test by observation and measurement, but a theory about what it means to observe and measure.</q> Beyond a very specific
      threshold of precision, what quantum mechanics predicts is not what value
      you will measure as a property of some physical object, but the <em>probabilities
       </em> of measurement outcomes.  It is a theory about <q>knowability</q>
      itself. And, similarly to our discussion of thermodynamics in Chapter
      Nineteen, in QM the problem of knowability extends beyond the mere
      limitations of precision in our measurements or the effects of measurement
      on the thing being measured; it raises questions about whether certain
      properties that are meaningful on large scales continue to be meaningful
      on the smallest scales.</p>
    <p>In <cite>From Eternity to Here</cite>, Sean Carroll discusses QM at length
      and has this to say about the knowability problem:  <q>According to quantum mechanics, what we can <em>observe</em> about the world is only a tiny subset of what actually <em>exists</em>.</q> 
      He calls this the  <q>single basic difference</q> between classical and quantum physics, a principle which has
      implications of the greatest importance but is too often <q>watered down</q> in
      attempts to explain it.</p>
    <p>Before we dive into the details, I&apos;m going to offer a thought for us to
      keep in mind going forward. In Chapter Seven, I asked you to imagine a
      universe in which the speed of light (or of causality) was not limited; <strong>what
        if <i>c</i>=∞</strong>? I am going to propose a similar hypothetical
      here. What if there were physical quantities that could have a continuous
      range of values but still be measured to an unlimited degree of precision?
      Take energy for example: what if a particle could have exactly  <i>e</i>
      or &pi; or √2 units of energy? How much information would be contained in
      each and every particle? Each of those quantities has an infinite number
      of digits, so how would nature keep track of them all? In a volume
      containing many such particles, how much information would be in that
      volume? On the other hand, what if a particle could only have energy equal
      to a whole-number multiple of some basic quantity, which we could call <i>h</i>?
      In that case, each particle would represent a <em>finite</em> amount of
      information for nature to keep track of. If <i>h</i> is infinitesimal,
      then it has no consequence; particles can have any value they like. But if
      it has some finite value, however small, a particle can only take on
      energy values of discrete amounts. So this chapter&apos;s question is, <strong>what
        if <i>h</i>&gt;1/∞</strong>?
     </p>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>The scientific community of the 20th century developed quantum mechanics
      in spite of itself. QM evolved in a series of tentative yet radical steps,
      with many contributors in the process thinking that the next theorist in
      line took matters too far.  Max Planck invented <i>h</i> (Planck&apos;s 
      constant) in 1900 as a kludge on which he built a reasonable formula for
      the frequency distribution of light emitted by hot objects; he didn&apos;t like
      the necessity of the constant and made considerable effort to dispense
      with it before finally conceding its necessity. When Albert Einstein used
      <i>h</i> five years later to explain the way certain metals emitted
      electrons when exposed to light, Planck found Einstein&apos;s conclusions hard
      to swallow. Einstein elevated Planck&apos;s constant from a  <em>kludge</em> to
      a <em>law of nature</em>; just as hot materials need a larger energy
      threshold to emit high-frequency light, light must meet an energy
      threshold to knock electrons loose from a material. And, Einstein said,
      that energy <i>E</i> depends not on the intensity of the light in terms
      of its brightness, but on its frequency <i>f</i>: <i>E=hf</i> (in
      that same year, Einstein established that <i>E=mc</i><sup>2</sup> in
      another paper). Whereas a red light of high intensity might fail to free
      any electrons from a material (by what is called the photoelectric
      effect), a higher-frequency blue light might accomplish it even at low
      levels of brightness. It was as if light were composed of individual
      bundles of energy having an energy level intrinsic to each individual
      bundle. The high-frequency bundles carried more energy and were able to
      produce effects that larger numbers of lower-energy bundles could not.
      These bundles of energy would come to be thought of as particles and would
      be called <dfn>quanta</dfn> or <dfn>photons</dfn>, and here were the
      beginnings of what became known as <dfn>quantum theory</dfn>. The theory
      was slow to take hold, of course, because it had long been known that
      light demonstrated the characteristics of waves; most significantly, light
      waves <em>interfered</em> with themselves. Two waves crossing one
      another would create relative bright and dark areas where their effects
      reinforced one another or cancelled out. Particles don&apos;t do that, for two
      reasons. First of all, because a particle is <em>localized</em> rather
      than repeating over space, and secondly because a particle won&apos;t share
      space with another particle.</p>
    <p>Einstein was famously unsatisfied by the direction that quantum theory
      took as it was extended into what we know today as quantum mechanics. Even
      Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger, whose equation for describing the  state
      of a quantum system might be considered the very capstone of QM, joined
      Einstein in criticizing and even lampooning the inadequacies of the theory
      (as described in this book&apos;s introduction). It&apos;s worth looking at how we
      got here. Chad Orzel<!--V:18 Orzel Timekeeping p. 230--> wrote:   <q>The final form of the theory came about through the convergence of many lines of evidence from different areas of physics,</q> and that&apos;s worth
      re-emphasizing. QM <em>works</em>, and that&apos;s why it is the way it is.
      From glowing molten iron to the photoelectric effect to the color spectrum
      of hydrogen gas, quantum mechanics has a mathematical model for radiation
      of all types, whether of the massless particles we think of as light or
      the massive alpha and beta particles associated with nuclear decay.</p>
    <p>David Lindley&apos;s <em>Uncertainty</em> gives a detailed yet readily
      readable history of QM&apos;s development, and I will be leaning on it heavily
      for my brief summary here. It&apos;s astonishing how much less we understood
      about atoms and subatomic particles in 1905 than we do today. Electrons
      had been discovered only eight years before by J. J. Thomson, and it would
      be another four years until Thomson&apos;s former student Ernest Rutherford
      discovered that most of the atom&apos;s mass was located in a central nucleus
      with the electrons&apos; domain comprising most of its volume. It wasn&apos;t until
      just before World War I that Rutherford&apos;s junior associate Niels Bohr
      proposed an organizational structure of electrons in the atom that
      explained why certain atoms give off certain frequencies of light and why
      they interact chemically as they do, falling into certain <q>periodic</q>
      groups in the table of elements. Electrons occupied states in the atom of
      different energy values and could transition between these states by
      absorbing or emitting light. Again using Planck&apos;s constant, Bohr provided
      a formula that predicted the precise frequencies of light corresponding to
      these energy state transitions; in rough terms, he showed the reason for
      each color of light emitted by a particular element. But in using Planck&apos;s 
      constant, Bohr was also establishing that electrons were not allowed any
      arbitrary energy state. The set of allowed values was discrete rather than
      continuous. It was as if electrons were planets circling a star, but with
      the puzzling condition that every star in the cosmos had the same limited
      set of stable orbits that a planet would be found in. In 1923 Louis de
      Broglie showed that what distinguished these <q>orbits</q> from all the rest
      was that the lengths of these particular ones corresponded to integer
      multiples of a certain wavelength. This naturally followed from the logic
      that if <i>E = hf</i> and if <i>E = mc</i><sup>2</sup>, then <i>hf
        = mc</i><sup>2</sup>; but the stroke of genius was to apply this
      relation to massive particles such as electrons, and not just to massless
      photons. De Broglie had reasoned that since the only places that integers
      appeared in classical physics had to do with wave interference and
      harmonics, then some sort of periodicity ought to be assigned to the
      electron.
      <!--Gribbin 88--></p>
    <p>Thus electrons were assigned a frequency and wavelength, and it wasn&apos;t
      long before experiments showed electron radiation with diffraction and
      interference patterns similar to those of light waves In fact, some of
      these effects had already been noticed in the laboratory before de Broglie
      had predicted them.<!--Gribbin 90--> We&apos;ll look at one such experiment in
      more detail later.<!--When was it, actually? Carroll says not until 1970s. Davisson/Germer was 1925-27 but double-slit was later?--></p>
    <p>By thinking of electrons as waves, we also dodge the question of how they
      <em>maintain</em> their orbit around the atom. A charged particle that
      accelerates must radiate electromagnetic energy, and going in rapid
      circles around a nucleus would be the kind of acceleration that would
      cause an electron to lose all of its energy in the merest fraction of a
      second. But if the electron is spread over the <em>entire</em> orbit, it
      isn&apos;t really accelerating, is it? On the other hand, if an electron is a
      wave, what is it a wave <em>of</em>? What does that even mean? And must
      we reconcile ourselves to the idea that electrons can go from one state to
      another without passing through any states in between, from here to there
      in a <q>quantum leap</q>? Rutherford had pointed this out to Bohr as a concern:<!-- SDH p. 57--></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>There appears to me one grave difficulty in your hypothesis, which I
        have no doubt you fully realize, namely, how does an electron decide
        what frequency it is going to vibrate at when it passes from one
        stationary state to the other? It seems to me you would have to assume
        that the electron knows beforehand where it is going to stop.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Another young physicist untethered to many of the concerns and
      preconceptions of the older generation also brought fresh eyes to the
      question of what sorts of oscillation would correspond to the light
      frequencies observed in atomic light emission and absorption. His name was
      Werner Heisenberg. I will quote here from <cite>Uncertainty</cite>:<!--p 110-111--></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>In the classic but pertinent example, any vibration of a violin string,
        no matter how harsh or discordant, is equal to some weighted combination
        of the string&apos;s pure tones, its fundamental and harmonics. Heisenberg
        was already thinking of an atom as a set of oscillators. Now it occurred
        to him to take that imagery to its fullest conclusion.  <q>The idea suggested itself,</q> he said in a lecture three decades later,
          <q>that one should write down the mechanical laws not as equations for the positions and velocities of the electrons but as equations for the frequencies and amplitudes of their Fourier expansion.</q> Heisenberg&apos;s bland phrase
        doesn&apos;t begin to convey the bizarre and radical nature of what he was
        aiming to do[.]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This would take de Broglie&apos;s idea of electron waves one step further.
      Lindley calls Heisenberg&apos;s willingness to consider position and momentum
      as <em>secondary</em> characteristics of particles emerging from a more
       <em>fundamental</em> consideration of their oscillatory frequencies and
      amplitudes a <q>revolutionary reversal.</q> After tabulating the numbers
      associated with various energy transitions, Heisenberg found that the
      mechanical energy of an atom must itself be quantized as well as the
      energies of the light it absorbs and emits. Heisenberg was fortunate that
      his assistanceship with Max Born afforded him Born&apos;s insights into matrix
      multiplication (Chapter Nineteen), a subject that had not yet emerged from
      obscurity and was known to relatively few mathematicians at the time. Born
      recognized the applicability of matrix algebra to Heisenberg&apos;s 
      calculations and they cooperated in publishing the formulation of a new <dfn>quantum
        mechanics</dfn> in 1925. Heisenberg&apos;s version would come to be called <dfn>matrix
        mechanics</dfn> to distinguish it from Schr&ouml;dinger&apos;s <dfn>wave
        mechanics</dfn>, which was also postulated in 1925 and published the
      following year. Though the two systems are effectively equivalent, wave
      mechanics has taken the fore. Both are dependent on the Fourier transform,
      and thus are subject to the same ambiguities seen in Chapter Twenty-Six:
      it turns out that position and momentum are Fourier conjugates, meaning
      that the more precisely one is defined, the more ambiguity inheres in the
      other. Heisenberg was the first to notice this relation, beginning in the
      summer of 1925, and in 1927 published the paper that made him famous:  <q>On the Observable Content of Quantum-theoretical Kinematics and Mechanics.</q>
      He used several terms to describe the principle, including <i>Ungenauigkeit</i>
      (inexactness or imprecision) and <i>Unbestimmtheit</i> (indeterminacy)
      but it was Bohr&apos;s favored term, <i>Unsicherheit,</i> that Heisenberg
      included in an endnote and somehow became the adjective with which we
      refer to Heisenberg&apos;s Uncertainty Principle.</p>
    <p>Even after Schr&ouml;dinger came up with his wave equation, he wasn&apos;t
      certain what it meant. Again, a wave of <em>what</em>? The formula had
      been inspired by de Broglie, who with <i>hf=mc</i><sup>2</sup> had
      given us the idea of <em>matter waves</em>. When the wave equation showed
      that these waves tended to spread themselves out, Schr&ouml;dinger
      thought that maybe that meant that the associated particles would
      disintegrate. It was Max Born who suggested that the particles maintained
      their integrity and that the wave function associated with them reflected
      the <em>probability</em> of their being measured somewhere. Over time,
      the area in which they might be found would spread out. This is how we
      think about QM today: waves of probability. We&apos;ll discuss that idea here
      as well. In a manner typical of the history of QM, Schr&ouml;dinger
      didn&apos;t like what Born had done with his equation. Schr&ouml;dinger had
      held hopes of his equation describing smooth, deterministic changes over
      time rather than the seemingly acausal leaps described by Bohr and
      Heisenberg.  <q>I don&apos;t like it, and I&apos;m sorry I ever had anything to do with it,</q> he later remarked.
        <q>Had I known that we were not going to get rid of this damned quantum jumping, I never would have involved myself in this business.</q><!--Gribbin, p. 117--></p>
    <p>With this groundwork now laid, it was an excellent time for the
      architects of quantum physics to convene. A conference was held in
      Brussels in late October 1927, attended by Planck, Einstein, Bohr, de
      Broglie, Heisenberg, Born and Schr&ouml;dinger, among others. Marie
      Curie, who was not an active contributor in quantum physics but who had
      pioneered the field of research in atomic decay, was in attendance. So was
      Hendrik Lorentz, who had laid some of the groundwork for relativity. The
      Fifth Solvay Conference brought together a breathtaking amount of
      scientific talent, as seen in this photo:</p>

    <p>As Heisenberg and Bohr were satisfied that the quantum revolution was
      complete, Einstein voiced concerns to some conference attendees that there
      were still gaps in the theory demanding to be filled. Einstein had been
      enthusiastic about developments in the theory, but maintained that a <em>complete
       </em> theory would not leave so much to mere chance.  No one could
      answer the question of <em>why</em> an electron emitted light and
      transitioned to a lower energy state when it did; it was only understood
      that these two things would happen together, whenever that was. Likewise,
      it was still a mystery when an atom would decay; even in the following
      year or two, when a quantum formula was discovered for <em>how</em> decay
      took place, there was still no reason <em>why</em>.</p>
    <p>Einstein made no presentation at the conference but participated in
      smaller discussions after hours, pointing out an apparent causality
      problem caused by the dual wave and particle aspects of photons and
      electrons. George Musser makes an apt analogy of Einstein&apos;s argument in
      this way:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&hellip; suppose light is ultimately a wave, but gives the impression of
        being particulate because atoms absorb wave energy in discrete bites.
        Most of Einstein&apos;s contemporaries adopted this picture. But Einstein saw
        very early on that it ran afoul of what the physicist John Cramer of the
        University of Washington has called the <q>bubble paradox.</q> A wave would
        spread out from its source like an inflating bubble. Upon reaching an
        atom, the bubble would pop &mdash;the wave would collapse and concentrate all
        its energy in that one place, like an ocean wave breaking in a narrow
        cove. By that point, the bubble could be huge; the collapse would happen
        abruptly over a large region. How would distant parts of the bubble know
        that they should cease propagating outward?
        <!--Musser, p. 88(-89). See also Lindley, p. 160. --></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To visualize this, return to the <q><a href="section_1.html#Circus" target="_blank">Circus
        Canon</a></q> animation near the beginning of this book. If the ringing of
      each bell produced one quantum of energy, that energy could be absorbed at
      one and only one place and time. Notice that the expanding <q>bubble</q> of
      each tone disappears entirely from the animation as soon as it reaches the
      clown and is heard. </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Quantum mechanics demands a new perspective on cause and effect. It is as
      though each tone must be heard by one and only one clown, even though its
      energy radiates in all directions. All parts of the wave, regardless of
      their distance, need to take part in maintaining this rule together; and
      yet we expect that no such coordination could take place faster than the
      speed of light even though such would seem to be required. In Section
      Four, I will present some of the ways we might resolve this problem.</p>
    <p>By the time of the Sixth Solvay Conference in 1930, what became known as
      the <q>Einstein-Bohr debates</q> were well underway. Einstein came armed with a
      new <q>thought experiment</q> designed to demonstrate a flaw in Heisenberg&apos;s 
      uncertainty principle; to show that it was possible to gather more
      information than the principle allowed. As well as demanding a trade-off
      between measurements of position and velocity, Heisenberg&apos;s principle also
      required a minimum uncertainty between energy and time: the more certain
      you are of the time of some quantum transition, the less you can know
      about the quantity of energy involved. Einstein proposed that there could
      be a box containing photons, and that a shutter could be opened at a
      precise time and for a precise duration to allow one photon to escape the
      box. The box would sit on a scale, and if the scale were accurate enough,
      one could measure the energy of the missing photon by multiplying the
      difference of the mass of the box by <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> (<i>E=mc</i><sup>2</sup>).
      Bohr was unprepared for Einstein&apos;s criticism at first, and seemed visibly
      unnerved; but he soon countered with something from Einstein&apos;s own
      arsenal. For one thing, he replied, the sudden change in mass in the box
      would temporarily cause it to bounce up and down on the springs of the
      scale and to produce an uncertain measurement of the mass, and therefore
      of the energy of the photon. This motion of the box would further
      complicate matters by affecting the rate of the clock that controls the
      shutter. "Bohr explained with satisfaction that the product of these two
      uncertainties, in energy and time, was precisely what Heisenberg&apos;s 
      principle said it should be," writes Lindley.</p>
    <p>In 1930,
      <!--https://www.informationphilosopher.com/quantum/copenhagen/ -->Heisenberg
      named the interpretation of quantum mechanics that he shared with Bohr the
      <i>Kopenhagener Geist</i>, or <q>spirit of Copenhagen.</q> English-speaking
      physicists have called this school of thought the  <q>Copenhagen interpretation</q> 
      in the decades since, and it is this interpretation of QM
      that has held dominance. In 1932, John von Neumann offered (in the words
      of Louisa Gilder)  <q>proof that an underlying causal structure could not exist, [thus] keeping the innards of the quantum theoretical beast numinous and ineffable.</q>
      <!--p 195)-->Einstein fired one last shot at the Copenhagen interpretation
      in 1935 before letting the matter rest publicly. We&apos;ll talk about that,
      the so-called EPR paradox. But before we can do that well, we&apos;ll need to
      look more closely at the sorts of things that QM predicts and which have
      been experimentally verified.</p>
    <h4>Interference</h4>
    <p>One of the key features of quantum mechanics is <em>interference</em>,
      which blurs the distinction between waves of energy on one hand and mass
      on the other. As discussed in Chapter Twelve, waves interfere in ways that
      are easily observable. The influence of two separate wave sources will add
      where they are in agreement and cancel out where they are in disagreement.
      Below in Figure 27-4 we see planes waves coming form the left and
      approaching a barrier with two apertures in it, each of which has a width
      which is comparable to the length of the waves. These apertures become
      point-like sources of waves which continue through the barrier to the
      right. The waves from these two sources interfere in such a way that by
      the time their effects reach the right-hand side, there are alternating
      segments down the right-hand side where the wave action is strong and
      weak. If the plane waves on the left were light waves, a photographic
      plate on the far right would have bands of high and low exposure that
      alternated from top to bottom.</p>

    <p>This sort of interaction is far less common between masses, due not only
      to the previously-mentioned facts that masses tend to be concentrated in a
      specific volume rather than spread over space and that two masses will not
      share the same volume of space, but also (and perhaps more significantly)
      because masses are never opposite in value and thus cannot  <q>destructively interfere</q> 
      based on opposite value. A wave can both rise and fall, but a
      mass will never have a value of less than zero.</p>
    <p>It&apos;s surprising, therefore, to observe interference between particles
      having mass, as we do with electrons. It is possible to send a stream of
      electrons through a pair of apertures much like the arrangement in Figure
      27-4 and to place a screen on the right-hand side to see where each
      electron <q>lands,</q> much like the arrival of light can be detected by a
      photographic film. Under the right conditions, it will become clear over
      time that there are alternating areas on the screen that detect more and
      fewer incoming electrons. Each electron leaves a mark on the screen at a
      localized point, as we would expect a particle to do, but the probability
      of electrons being detected at any given point rises and falls at regular
      intervals of space in a pattern of wave-like interference between the two
      aperture sources. This arrangement is commonly known as a  <q>double slit experiment.</q>  
      If the electrons behaved entirely as particles, we
      might expect only two areas of relatively dense dots, each corresponding
      to one of the apertures or slits. But this is not the case; the
      interference pattern will have the multiple bands of density we would
      expect from waves.</p>
    <p>The interference between multiple electrons is surprising enough, but the
      interference pattern still persists over time if the electron flow slows
      down to a rate of <q>one at a time.</q> Even if the electrons are emitted from
      their source on the left at a rate of one per minute, the dots that they
      make on the detection screen on the right (speaking of course only of
      those electrons that don&apos;t bounce off of the barrier in the middle) will
      still resolve over time into bands of light and dark where more and fewer
      electrons arrive (as in Figure 27-5, which has vertical bands rather than
      the horizontal ones we would see in Figure 27-4). It is as if each
      electron crossing the middle barrier is a wave passing through <em>both</em> slits
      and interfering <em>with itself</em>. Or perhaps we ought to say that
      each electron is associated with a wave of <em>probability</em> that
      demonstrates self-interference.</p>

    <p>We may ask which of the two slits a given electron <em>actually</em> passed
      through, and of course we can imagine or perhaps even construct a system
      in which an electron detector is positioned next to each slit, or even one
      of the two, to notify us when an electron passes it. But as soon as we do
      that, the electrons begin behaving differently. The electrons passing
      through the top slit will tend to land at one place on the screen, and
      those passing through the lower slit will collect at another. The extent
      to which the interference pattern appears on the screen is directly
      proportional to the electrons&apos; ability to pass through either slit
      undetected and unaffected. The experiment itself is fundamentally
      different when there is an interaction at one or more of the apertures and
      when the screen itself is no longer the only detector. It&apos;s tempting to
      suspect that the electrons can tell whether anyone is watching and that
      they change their behavior accordingly, but it may be more useful to
      suppose that by placing a reliable detector at one of the slits we aren&apos;t
      merely <em>looking</em> at the electrons as they pass by but actually <em>touching</em> each of them. This still doesn&apos;t quite explain the change in
      behavior, but it&apos;s a step in the right direction. We&apos;ll need to reconsider
      many of our assumptions about space and time before we are done.</p>
    <h4> The wave function</h4>
    <p>So far we have mentioned a (hypothetical) <em>probability wave</em> associated
      with the electrons in the double-slit experiment, and an equation of a <em>wave function</em> that has to do with this probability. It seems likely
      that you&apos;re wondering what this really means, so let&apos;s take a look. Before
      we go into many details, we ought to review some terms and concepts. By
      function, we mean a mathematical relationship between one variable and
      another. A typical way to look at a quantum-mechanical wave function is
      the relationship between a position <i>x</i> and a probability <i>P</i>.
      Specifically, the probability <i>P</i> of a given particle being found
      at position <i>x</i> when we go to measure its position. We put <i>x</i>
      on the horizontal axis and &psi; (the square root of <i>P</i>, for reasons
      that should become clear later on) on the vertical axis, and draw a curve.
      If we are really confident that the particle is at <i>x</i>=7, we draw
      a flat line on the x axis with a sharp bump at <i>x</i>=7 (Figure
      26-16, previous chapter). As Werner Heisenberg found, though, we get more
      mileage out of this function &psi;(<i>x</i>) if we can split it up into
      a series of sinusoidal <em>waves</em>, however many waves as it takes to
      accurately describe the curve; this is done with the Fourier analysis
      discussed in Chapter Twenty-Six. And what benefit do we get from this? We
      get the probability distribution of the particle&apos;s momentum. We&apos;ll look at
      a specific example of this in a moment.</p>
    <p>When we are less certain about a particle&apos;s location, when its
      probabilities are spread out over some range of <i>x</i>, its wave
      function looks different from the abrupt spike associated with a single,
      certain position. And it&apos;s here that complex numbers come into play. Watch
      how, and then see if it seems like a cheat to you like it does to me. What
      we&apos;re going to look at is a function &psi; of position <i>x</i> and time <i>t</i> that is a combination (a sum or superposition) of several sine
      functions &psi;<sub>1</sub>(<i>x,t</i>) + &psi;<sub>2</sub>(<i>x,t</i>)
      <i>&hellip;+</i> &psi;<i><sub>n</sub></i>(<i>x,t</i>)<i>;</i> but each of
      these functions is <i>complex-valued</i>, as in &psi;<i><sub>n</sub></i>(<i>x,t</i>)<i>
     </i> = <i>A<sub>n</sub>e<sup>i(k<sub>n</sub>x-</sup></i><i><sup><i>&omega;</i><sub>n</sub>t)</sup></i>
      = <i>A<sub>n</sub></i> cos (<i>k<sub>n</sub>x-</i><i><i>&omega;<sub>n</sub></i>t</i>)
      + <i>iA<sub>n</sub></i> sin (<i>k<sub>n</sub>x</i>-<i><i>&omega;</i><sub>n</sub>t</i>).
      In other words, for each position <i>x</i> at time <i>t</i> the
      function &psi;(<i>x,t</i>) will return a complex number; each
      of the components &psi;<i><sub>n</sub></i>(<i>x,t</i>) that make up 
      &psi;(<i>x,t</i>) will have their particular amplitude <i>A<sub>n</sub></i>
      and their particular spatial density <i>k<sub>n</sub></i> (Equation
      27-1). A complex number as a function of <i>x</i> is tricky to graph in
      two dimensions, but imagine that the imaginary part of &psi; goes on the
      vertical axis and the real part is graphed perpendicular to both that and
      the <i>x</i> axis, perhaps into and out of this page. If we rotate it
      slightly (Figure 26-15, below), we can get a better sense of its
      three-dimensional shape:</p>

    <p>Figure 26-15 represents a particle which is probably moving to the right
      and whose position is becoming less certain over time (the wave flattens
      and spreads out somewhat). (It is also one of the wave functions we
      analyzed in Chapter Twenty-Six, where we also talked about complex-valued
      wave functions. If you skipped that chapter you may become lost in what
      follows.) Where the wave is wide, we can see that its graph circles the <i>x</i>
      axis without intersecting it. If we were to look at this function
      top-down, we would see the real-valued part of &psi; crossing in front of and
      behind the <i>x</i> axis and we might think that the probability
      associated with the function goes to zero where it crosses the axis. But
      those are the values of <i>x</i> for which the imaginary-valued part of
      &psi; is greatest, and we would see that if we looked at the graph straight on
      from the side. The result is that even though this function oscillates in
      a wave-like fashion, its <em>magnitude</em> curves more smoothly over <i>x</i>,
      rising from minimal values up to a maximum and then back down again, never
      going below zero. And it is this magnitude, not the up/down or in/out
      direction in which the function points, that gives us the probability of
      measuring the particle at any given point. If we had used only real-valued
      sine functions to compose this wave functions, then there would be
      repeating values of <i>x</i> having some probability, with values of
      zero probability in between them, which would be very strange. So instead
      we have a sum of complex-valued functions, which is arguably no less
      strange. We are in very abstract mathematical territory here.</p>   
    <p>
      Once more: we take a large number of complex-valued traveling waves like the
      one shown in Figure 12-7, add them up so that they interfere constructively
      in one place and destructively everywhere else (as shown in Chapter
      Twenty-Six), and if we choose the correct set of amplitudes and wavelengths
      then together they will form a traveling wave like the one shown in Figure
      26-15. The wave function for all of this will look something like this, with
      <i>n</i> terms on the right-hand side for <i>n</i> component waves,
      each having their particular amplitude <i>A</i>, wavenumber <i>k</i>
      and frequency <i>&omega;</i>:

    <p>One benefit from doing all this is that to get the momentum probability
      distribution for the particle represented by this superposition of waves,
      we don&apos;t need to do the Fourier transform. We could if we needed to, and
      that&apos;s often the way to do it, but in this case we have already done it in
      reverse. We already know the amplitudes <i>A<sub>n</sub></i> and the
      wave densities <i>k<sub>n</sub></i> that we gave to each component of
      the composite wave as we built it up (Equation 27-1). For a visual
      refresher, go back to look at Figure 26-13. As each wave appears at the
      top of the figure it has a visibly consistent amplitude <i>A</i> and
      wavenumber <i>k</i>. The amplitude of each component wave determines
      the probability of measuring the particle to have a momentum associated
      with that component&apos;s wavenumber <i>k</i>.</p>
    <p>Wait, what? Yes, the wavenumber (or wave density) of the overall wave
      function is what determines the momentum of the particle. Weird, I know.
      Each component sine wave in Figure 26-13 has a specific momentum
      associated with it, and the composite wave in Figure 26-15 is a <em>superposition
       </em> of several different sine waves and thus of several different
      momenta. (See also Figure 26-4c). Thanks to de Broglie  <q>not knowing any better</q> 
      than to apply the same rules to matter as to energy, we know
      that position relates to wavenumber in the following manner:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><i>p= &hstrok;k<!--Fleisch 64-65--></i></p>
      <p><b>Equation 27-2</b>. <span class="equation_description">Momentum <i>p</i> equals wavenumber
        <i>k</i> times Planck&apos;s reduced constant <i>&hstrok;</i> (<i>h</i>
        divided by 2&pi;).</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I&apos;ll say this again more clearly: If you have a function that shows the
      probabilities that a particle will be measured at each <em>position</em> on
      the <i>x</i> axis, then you already have all the information about the
      probability distribution of the particle&apos;s <em>momentum</em> in the <i>x</i>
      direction. That distribution is shown by doing a Fourier transform of the
      function to change from the <i>x</i> domain to the <i>k</i> domain.
      (see Chapter Twenty-Six for details). By the same token, if you have a
      function that describes the probability distribution of the particle being
      measured to have any particular value of momentum, then you can find out
      the probability distribution of its possible positions by applying the
      appropriate Fourier transform to take the function from the <i>k</i>
      domain to the <i>x</i> domain (again, Chapter Twenty-Six). Position and
      momentum are thus Fourier conjugate quantities, and this is the
      mathematical basis of Heisenberg&apos;s principle: a particle has a
      precisely-defined position only at the expense of having a
      precisely-defined momentum, and vice versa. When both quantities are
      equally well-defined, their distribution is the Gaussian distribution seen
      in Chapter Twenty-Six; and the product of their <dfn>standard deviations</dfn>
      (another statistical term) must in any case be no less than Planck&apos;s 
      constant divided by 4&pi;. That&apos;s a <em>really</em> small number,
      by the way, but the fact that this uncertainty must always be present has
      rightly given mankind cause for much thought. I&apos;ll offer some possible
      insights of my own in Section Four.</p>
    <p>Since the wave function is a matter of probabilities, we really ought to
      be clear that the probability function ψ along the <i>x</i> axis is
      rightly described as a matter of probability <em>density</em>. It&apos;s not
      that we want to be able to specify a certain probability of a particle
      being measured at some <em>exact</em> value of <i>x</i>; it&apos;s more
      practical to say that the wave function gives us a likelihood of a
      particle being measured between <em>two</em> values of <i>x</i>. We
      multiply (or integrate) the probability density for that range of <i>x</i>
      times the distance between those two <i>x</i> values to get a
      probability; it&apos;s related to the area under the ψ curve between the two <i>x</i>
      values. Over the entire range of <i>x</i>, that probability must add up
      to one; the particle&apos;s location, when measured, has a one hundred percent
      chance of being at some value of <i>x</i>. I say that the probability
      is <em>related</em> to the area under the curve rather than simply being
      that area because the ψ function gives us not the probability per unit
      distance but the square root of it (for reasons that will shortly become
      clearer). To calculate the probability density at <i>x</i>, we multiply
      ψ(<i>x</i>) (which is a complex number) times its complex conjugate (see
      Chapter <i>i</i>) to get the square of its magnitude. That squared
      magnitude is the probability density at <i>x</i>.</p>
    <p>So, why the squaring? Sean Carroll, in <cite>Something Deeply Hidden</cite>,
      does a good job of explaining this (pages 86-87, if you are fortunate
      enough to have a copy on hand). Start by thinking of each possible
      measurement outcome as a component of a vector having length one. I know,
      this is crazy, but bear with me. The Pythagorean theorem tells us that it
      is not the magnitudes of the components themselves that must add to the
      total vector length, but the squares of their magnitudes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>That&apos;s the simple geometric fact underlying the Born rule for quantum
        probabilities. Amplitudes themselves don&apos;t add up to one, but their
        squares do. That is exactly like an important feature of probability:
        the sum of probabilities for different outcomes needs to equal one. &hellip;
        Another rule is that probabilities need to be non-negative numbers. Once
        again, amplitudes squared fit the bill: amplitudes can be negative (or
        complex), but their squares are non-negative real numbers.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I&apos;m not going to pretend that I fully comprehend this principle yet;
      after several months, I am still not over my  <q>how could anyone think to perform such witchcraft with numbers</q> phase in regard to treating
      functions as vectors, as one does in QM. My introduction to the idea was
      in Dan Fleisch&apos;s  <cite>A Student&apos;s Guide to the Schr&ouml;dinger Equation</cite>,
      and I recommend it as a complement to other sources such as MIT&apos;s 
      OpenCourseWare materials, specifically the Physics 8.04 course.</p>
    <p>It helps to ease your way into this idea like a really hot bath rather
      than jumping in all at once. If it hurts your brain to think about every
      point along an axis being associated to a vector at right angles to its
      neighbors and the vectors associated with every other point on the axis,
      creating a space of infinite dimension, start smaller. Pick a point on the
      axis where the probability associated with the wave function is equal on
      either side of it and imagine a vector space of just two variables or
      <q>dimensions.</q> 
      This isn&apos;t a <q>space</q> in the sense we may be used to where
      every direction is associated with some direction in the physical world;
      this is an <em>abstract vector space</em>. Then work your way up from
      there; make ten divisions of the domain, or an infinite number having some
      finite width.</p>
    <p>Later in this chapter we&apos;ll look at some measurable properties that only
      give binary responses of <q>yes</q> 
      or <q>no,</q> and that actually are represented
      by abstract spaces of only two dimensions. But apart from these basis
      vectors having a direction representing some answer, and a magnitude
      representing the square root of a probability of that answer, they aren&apos;t
      much different from some vectors that we have already considered. The
      four-velocity vector represented in Figures 20-6 and ii-10 (based on the
      Poincar&eacute;  standard for spacetime) also has multiple components that always
      sum up to the same invariant value when squared, namely <i>c</i>. The
      <q>components</q> of the 
      wavefunction <q>vector,</q> whatever their values may be,
      will likewise always come to one when squared and then summed up.</p>
    <p><b>The Schr&ouml;dinger equation</b></p>
    <p>All right then, we have seen an example of what a wave function
      associated with some particle might look like. So what is the Schr&ouml;dinger
      wave equation and what does it have to do with our example? The Schr&ouml;dinger
      equation is a sort of rule for wave equations that describe particles; it
      is a differential equation that describes, for instance, how a particular
      wave equation will change over time. As discussed in Chapter Fourteen,
      differential equations describe relationships between functions and their
      derivatives, whereas functions describe relationships between variables.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Let&apos;s go through the quantities in the equation one by one. The first, <i>i</i>,
      is of course the imaginary number discussed in detail in Chapter <i>i</i>.
      Since the wavefunction &psi; is in terms of <i>Ae<sup>i(kx-</sup></i><i><sup><i>&omega;</i>t)</sup></i>,
      its partial derivative with respect to time, <i>&part;</i>&psi;/<i>&part;t</i>,
      will be some multiple of <i>i</i>, such as <i><i>i</i><i><i>&omega;</i></i>e<sup>i(kx-</sup></i><i><sup><i>&omega;</i>t)</sup></i>.
      So this <i>i</i> multiplying <i>&part;</i>&psi;/<i>&part;t</i> on the left-hand
      side of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation has the effect of
      making the left-hand side a real-valued multiple of &psi; rather than an
      imaginary one: <i>i</i> times <i>i</i> is -1, a real number. The
      number <i>&hstrok;</i> is a scaling constant. If &psi; = 
      <i>Ae<sup>i(kx-&omega;t)</sup></i>,
      then <i>&part;&psi;/&part;t</i> = 
      -<i>i&omega;A</i>&psi;
      and <i>i&hstrok;</i>(<i>&part;</i>&psi;/<i>&part;t</i>) = 
      <i>&hstrok;&omega;A</i>&psi;
      = <i>hfA</i>&psi;. But keep in mind that &psi; can be the superposition of
      several different waves each having their own <i>A</i>, <i>k</i>,
      and <i>&omega;</i> values. So in the more general case,
      the left-hand side could be interpreted as <i>hf</i><sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub>&psi;<sub>1</sub>
      + <i>hf</i><sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>&psi;<sub>2</sub> + &hellip; <i>hf<sub>n</sub></i>A<i><sub>n</sub></i>&psi;<i><sub>n</sub></i>
      ). Noticing the <i>hf</i> factor,  you might recognize this as
      having something to do with energy (<i>E</i>=<i>hf</i>). What we have
      on the left hand side is one representation of the energy associated with
      the wavefunction &psi;, and this representation is the sum of all
      the energies associated with its <q>parts,</q> the pure sine waves that make it
      up.</p>
    <p>This being an equation, the right hand side must necessarily be a matter
      of energies associated with the wave function as well. <i>V</i> is a <em>potential
       </em> energy associated with the particle, having to do with the
      electrical or gravitational potential at a particular place and time,
      dependent on the value of a field at <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>. 
      The rest of the right-hand side is the <em>kinetic</em> energy, and
      we&apos;ll break that down too. But notice that the addition of the kinetic and
      potential energies is how we get the Hamiltonian (Chapter Fourteen). For
      this reason, the entire right-hand side is sometimes written as Ĥ&psi;, with Ĥ
      being the <q>Hamiltonian operator</q> - (<i>&hstrok;</i><sup>2</sup>/2<i>m</i>)(<i>&part;<sup>2</sup></i>/<i>&part;x</i><sup>2</sup>)+V
      = <i>i</i><i>&hstrok;</i><i>&part;</i>/<i>&part;t.</i></p>
    <p>All right, let&apos;s see how kinetic energy comes out of -( <i>&hstrok;</i><sup>2</sup>/2<i>m</i>)(<i>&part;<sup>2</sup></i>&psi;/<i>&part;x</i><sup>2</sup>).
      If &psi; = <i>Ae<sup>i(kx-</sup></i><i><sup><i>&omega;</i>t)</sup></i>, then
      <i>&part;</i>&psi;/<i>&part;x</i> = <i>Aik</i>&psi; and <i><br>
     </i> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>&part;<sup>2</sup></i>&psi;/<i>&part;x</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>A</i><i>i</i><sup>2</sup><i>k</i><sup>2</sup>&psi;
        = <i>-A</i><i>k</i><sup>2</sup>&psi;.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="equation">
      <p><b>Equation 27-4.</b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If we substitute the right-hand side of Equation 27-4 into the place
      where the left-hand side appears in the kinetic energy term of the Schr&ouml;dinger
      equation [-( <i>&hstrok;</i><sup>2</sup>/2<i>m</i>)(<i>&part;<sup>2</sup></i>&psi;/<i>&part;x</i><sup>2</sup>],
      we get:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>&hstrok;</i><sup>2</sup><i>A</i><i>k</i><sup>2</sup>&psi;/2<i>m</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Remembering that momentum <i>p</i> = <i>&hstrok;k</i>, we can substitute<i>
        p</i><sup>2</sup> for <i>h</i><sup>2</sup><i>k</i><sup>2</sup>:<i>
        
     </i> </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>A</i><i>p</i><sup>2</sup>&psi;/2<i>m</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Finally, remembering that <i>p=mv</i> and therefore <i>p</i><sup>2</sup>
      = <i>m</i><sup>2</sup><i>v</i><sup>2</sup>, we can substitute ½<i>mv</i><sup>2</sup>
      for <i>p</i><sup>2</sup>/2<i>m</i>: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>½<i>mv</i><sup>2</sup><i>A</i>&psi;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And of course ½<i>mv</i><sup>2</sup> is the classical formula for
      kinetic energy <i>K</i>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>A</i><i>K</i>&psi;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But as before, we have to bear in mind the general case in which the wave
      function &psi; represents the sum of one <em>or more</em> different pure
      waves, so the right-hand side of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation
      becomes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&psi;<sub>1</sub><i>A</i><sub>1</sub>[<i>K</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>V</i>]
        + &psi;<sub>2</sub><i>A</i><sub>2</sub>[<i>K</i><sub>2</sub> + <i>V</i>]
        &hellip; + &psi;<i><sub>n</sub>A<sub>n</sub></i>[<i>K<sub>n</sub></i>
        + <i>V</i>]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Let&apos;s put the left- and right-hand sides together now:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>hf</i><sub>1</sub>&psi;<sub>1</sub><i>A</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>hf</i><sub>2</sub>&psi;<sub>2</sub><i>A</i><sub>2</sub>
        &hellip; + <i>hf</i><sub>n</sub>&psi;<i><sub>n</sub>A<sub>n</sub></i>
        = &psi;<sub>1</sub><i>A</i><sub>1</sub>[<i>K</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>V</i>]
        + &psi;<sub>2</sub><i>A</i><sub>2</sub>[<i>K</i><sub>2</sub> + <i>V</i>]
        &hellip; + &psi;<i><sub>n</sub>A<sub>n</sub></i>[<i>K<sub>n</sub></i>
        + <i>V</i>]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Broken down this way, the Schr&ouml;dinger equation equates the
      <q>Hamiltonian</q> of a particle (the sum of its kinetic and potential energies
      <i>K + V</i>) to its <q>quantum</q> energy <i>hf</i> (which is Planck&apos;s 
      constant times some frequency associated to this particle and its energy
      via the wave function). But more than that, it relates the curvature of
      the function over differences in <i>x</i> (<i>&part;<sup>2</sup></i>&psi;/<i>&part;x</i><sup>2</sup>)
      to its changes over time (<i>&part;</i>&psi;/<i>&part;t</i>); one of the equation&apos;s 
      under-emphasized properties is that it is a diffusion equation, much like
      the one Fourier was looking for when he did his most famous work.  In
      Figure 26-15 we see a wave function that tends to flatten and spread out.
   </p>
    <p>There&apos;s an interesting quantity that came out of Arthur Compton&apos;s 
      experiments with scattering x-rays off of atoms in the early 1920s called
      the Compton wavelength. This is wavelength associated with any particle of
      a given mass, for example an electron, and is the wavelength of a photon
      having the same energy as the <q>rest energy</q> associated with that mass by
      the relation <i>E=mc</i><sup>2</sup>. It&apos;s not anything terribly
      difficult to understand, and I <q>invented</q> it independently just doing the
      same sort of algebra that de Broglie did. If you get that <i>E=hf</i>
      and <i>v=f&lambda;</i> then you might also have found the Compton wavelength <i>&lambda;<sub>C</sub>=</i>
      <i>h/mc</i> interesting. Doing the same sort of algebra, we can rewrite
      the Schr&ouml;dinger equation to include the Compton wavelength:</p>

      <p><b>Equation 27-5.</b>  <span class="equation_description">The Schr&ouml;dinger equation
        rewritten to include the Compton wavelength.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Doing that, we might notice the factor <i>c</i><i>&lambda;<sub>C</sub></i>
      as a possible diffusion constant (being in units of velocity <i>c</i>
      times length <i>&lambda;<sub>C</sub></i>, it has units equivalent to area per
      time) for a diffusion equation, which in general will have the form:</p>
    <blockquote class="equation">

      <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Equation 27-6.</b> <span class="equation_description">The general
        form of a diffusion equation.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>where &alpha; is a diffusion constant in units of area per time, and &psi; is a
      function of <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>.</p>
    <p>The Schr&ouml;dinger equation is elegant in its utility.
      Practical-minded physicists can solve many different problems with it. And
      the same can be said of the wave function that lies at the heart of it. If
      it weren&apos;t so utterly useful, it wouldn&apos;t cause such fits among more
      philosophically-minded physicists. The cause for so much concern is that
      at the moment a quantum system is actually <em>measured</em>, the wave
      function stops behaving in the way that the Schr&ouml;dinger equation
      tells us it should. A wave function that represents a superposition of
      measurable properties (what we call <q>observables</q>) is supposed to
      represent a particle in a superposition of states. For example, earlier in
      this chapter we looked at a wave function composed of several (or
      infinitely many) different wavenumbers and therefore representing a
      superposition of several different (or infinitely many) momenta. It is
      common to say that the particle represented by such a function is itself
      in a superposition of states, having not just one value of momentum but a
      weighted sum of many possible momenta. Over time, that distribution of
      probabilities for what we might eventually measure might change in
      accordance with the rules set by the Schr&ouml;dinger equation. But as
      soon as we manage to get a reliable and precise measurement of the
      particle&apos;s momentum, that superposition disappears, and the wavefunction
      is now the one associated with that single measured value. This is called
      the <q>collapse</q> of the wavefunction, because the prior superposition
      disappears. But the particle is always in superposition of specific
      positions, momenta or both. What happens upon precise measurement is that
      the superposition in one observable vanishes, and its conjugate
      observables go into superposition. And then the Schr&ouml;dinger
      equation takes over again, and the wave function changes gradually over
      time as expected.</p>
    <p>Popular-science texts on quantum mechanics understandably have a lot to
      say about <q>the collapse of the wavefunction,</q> pointing with disapproval at
      the lack of continuity. But how justified are we in crying foul in the
      case of this sudden change if we have already accepted that electrons will
      go from energy state to energy state without taking on any intermediate
      value, and that nucleons will tunnel their way outside of the decaying
      atom&apos;s electron cloud in similar fashion? All of these discontinuities
      partake of the same quantum nature. If we are dissatisfied with one, we
      might look for a more pleasing solution for all of them.</p>
    <h4>Electron spin and light polarization </h4>
    <p>In contrast to position and momentum, which can be measured over a
      continuous range of values, and energy, which can take on innumerable
      values that are integer multiples of some constant, there are some quantum
      measurements that can only produce one of two results. These properties
      have to do with electron spin and light polarization. A photon will never
      tell you what its angle of polarization is; it will only pass through or
      be blocked by a polarizing filter which is set at some angle. Similarly,
      if the angular momentum of an electron is along some particular axis
      before you measure it, you will never be able to determine it; you can
      only measure the angular momentum along an axis of your choosing, and note
      that the measured momentum of the electron is positive or negative in
      relation to that axis. We will discuss both of these properties in some
      detail and consider the philosophical problems they imply.</p>
    <p>We touched on electron spin briefly in Chapter Twenty-Four. Although
      electrons are not thought to have any width to speak of, they do
      demonstrate an angular momentum which requires conservation under the same
      physical laws governing a rotating or revolving object, and this angular
      momentum which we call <q>spin</q> also manifests itself as a magnetic field,
      just like that associated with any rotating charged mass. How something
      can have <q>spin</q> without having any width, radius, or even a well-defined
      location remains one of life&apos;s great mysteries.</p>
    <p>The Stern-Gerlach experiment of 1922 is one of the more famed experiments
      in modern physics. In it, silver atoms were shot into a magnetic field
      which was designed to deflect them according to the direction and
      magnitude of their own magnetic fields. A screen on the other side of the
      magnetic field recorded where the atoms landed. Even allowing for the
      possibility that the strength of the magnetic field was the same for each
      of the atoms, one might still have expected them to be deflected by
      varying degrees depending on the orientation of that field. Such was not
      the result. The atoms struck the detection screen in one of two spots,
      being deflected either in one direction or the other, and by a consistent
      amount. The result of the experiment is that we understand the angular
      momentum of electrons to be quantized and to have only one of two values
      when measured. More curiously, the answer we get from measurement seems to
      depend on how we frame the question: <em>all</em> of the electron&apos;s 
      angular momentum will be measured along (or opposite to) whichever
      arbitrary axis on which we measure it. This is in sharp contrast to
      classical measurements, in which our choice of measurement axes, our
      basis, will often give us complementary measurements along more than one
      axis that add up to some invariant value.</p>
    <p>And it isn&apos;t as though spin measurements have completely arbitrary
      results; If a particle is measured as having positive spin on some axis
      (it is measured as <q>spin up</q>), subsequent measurements taken along that
      same axis will have the same result &hellip; except in cases where the
      measurement along that axis follows a measurement taken along some other
      axis. You can measure <q>spin up</q> along the <i>x</i> axis as many times
      as you like, and you will still have no insight into whether a measurement
      taken along the <i>y</i> or <i>z</i> axis will give an answer of
      <q>up</q> or
       <q>down.</q> And as soon as you take a measurement of spin along one of
      those other axes, the result along the <i>x</i> axis loses its
      predictability as well; the probabilities become 50/50. Electron spin is
      an observable quantity with only semi-persistent meaning, affected by the
      very act of measuring it.</p>
    <p>It is common to say that before measurement with regard to some axis, an
      electron is in some superposition of <q>spin up</q> 
      and <q>spin down</q> states with
      regard to that axis. After all, it&apos;s highly unlikely that an electron you
      know nothing about has an axis of spin exactly aligned with your
      measurement apparatus. If we were talking about a classical object, we
      would say that it has an axis of spin with components on the <i>x</i>,
      <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> axes that can be added in superposition to get
      the actual orientation. In the quantum case, we talk about the probability
      of an <q>up</q> or
       a <q>down</q> result for a particular axis independently and as
      orthogonal vectors whose squares must add to a sum of one. The odds
      needn&apos;t be equal or completely biased in every case; if we run a stream of
      silver atoms or electrons through one spin detection apparatus that
      measures the spin with respect to the <i>x</i> axis, we can send the
      <q>up-</q>oriented particles to a second detector that is <em>almost</em> oriented
      along the <i>x</i> axis with the result that <em>most</em> of the
      particles will be measured as <q>up</q> in the second device.</p>
    <p>This sort of arrangement illustrates what I like to call the
      <q>Guildenstern dilemma</q> of binary quantum state measurement. In the opening
      scene of <cite>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</cite>, the two
      characters are betting on tossed coins. Rosencrantz has bet heads several
      dozen times in a row and has won each time, with the result that he
      carries a heavy purse; Guildenstern suspects that something deeply
      unsettling is at play and is more fascinated by the apparent suspension of
      the laws of probability than he is dismayed to be losing the money. Let&apos;s 
      now put them in the place of Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach. Rosencrantz
      has two spin measurement devices and has aligned them so that the
      particles measured by the first to be <q>spin up</q> on the <i>x</i> axis
      are fed into the second device, which will also measure spin along the <i>x</i>
      axis. Guildenstern feeds silver atoms one by one into the first device,
      and half of them proceed into the second, which measures each incoming
      particle to have <q>spin up.</q>  One atom after another, 
      the <q>spin up</q>
      result repeats itself. The dilemma is this: how can Guildenstern be
      certain that Rosencrantz has <em>exactly</em> aligned the two devices so
      that the second one will <em>always</em> produce the same result? Will
      he be satisfied after one hundred trials? One thousand? However many
      identical results are measured, the possibility remains that the next will
      be different.</p>
    <p>Photons also demonstrate such semi-predictable binary behavior, and this
      is the kind of experimentation you can easily perform at home. If
      unpolarized light is passed through a vertically-oriented polarizing
      filter, about half of the light will pass through the filter and will
      become vertically polarized in the process; if a second
      vertically-oriented filter is placed in the path, all the light that
      passed through the first will pass through the second. If a
      vertically-oriented filter is followed by a horizontally-oriented one, no
      light will pass through both of them. Note that there is nothing special
      about the vertical and horizontal orientations <i>per se</i>, other
      than the fact that they are at right angles to one another. These
      orientations are a somewhat arbitrary orthogonal <em>basis</em> for
      measuring the light in. A common way of describing the filtering effect is
      to say that the unpolarized light is in a superposition of the vertically-
      and horizontally-polarized states. This description would fit a classical
      sense of orientation, though awkwardly. What we would not expect
      classically is for this superposition to <q>collapse</q> upon passage through
      the filter to one state or the other. A vertically-oriented filter doesn&apos;t
      merely block the light that is mostly horizontal in its
      polarization and allow the passage of photons having polarization that is
      mostly vertical; once the light has passed through, its polarization <em>changes</em>.
   </p>
    <p>I said that no light would pass through both a vertically- and a
      horizontally-oriented filter, but as with the spin measurement example,
      there is an exception. If a third filter is placed between the first and
      second and is oriented at an angle that is neither fully vertical nor
      horizontal, it will change the polarization of the light that it does not
      block, and some of this light will pass through the next and final filter.
      Again, as with spin measurements, the interaction with the measurement
      apparatus changes the value of a quantity we might have hoped to measure.
   </p>

    <p><b>Entanglement</b></p>
    <p>The last major topic for this chapter is the one that generates the most
      controversy. We&apos;ll need to look at the distinction between classical and
      quantum behaviors and the meaning of measurement, and we&apos;ll need to
      reconsider our assumptions about space, time, and causality. We&apos;ll be
      talking about something called <dfn>quantum entanglement</dfn>. If I were
      to make a list of <q>most-deeply-misunderstood topics in physics,</q>
      entanglement would be near the top. I might be grossly oversimplifying
      when I say that entanglement means that the wave functions and quantum
      states (which are supposed to be the same thing) of more than one particle
      are not independent and cannot be separated, but that&apos;s the gist of it.
      There are a number of ways that the spin states of electrons and the
      polarizations of photons can become <em>correlated</em>; in other words,
      if you measure the property in one particle, you can know the outcome of
      measuring that same property in the other particle without having to make
      a second measurement. Some properties become correlated as the <em>same</em> value
      &mdash; two photons having the same polarization, for instance &mdash; and some become
      <em>anti-correlated</em>, as in the case of two electrons having opposite
      angular momenta. If you&apos;d like some technical detail on <em>how</em> particles
      become entangled, I recommend the <cite>Forbes</cite> article <q><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2017/02/28/how-do-you-create-quantum-entanglement/?sh=56bb3dc11732"
        target="_blank">How Do You Create Quantum Entanglement?</a></q>
      by Chad Orzel.</p>
    <p>One reason that entanglement has been so controversial is that entangled
      particles will behave exactly as if they have no fully defined state up
      until the time they are measured, but then the results of measurement will
      nonetheless demonstrate perfect correlation. It was such behavior that
      Einstein said made quantum mechanics not an incorrect but an <em>incomplete
       </em> theory; entanglement demands explanation. It is tempting to think
      that measurement of one entangled particle <em>causes</em> the
      correlated result in the other, but this correlation persists even over
      distances long enough to rule out such a cause-and-effect process at
      speeds equal to or less than the speed of light. Regarding <a href="%20https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement#History%20"

        target="_blank">Quantum entanglement</a>, Wikipedia has the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Schr&ouml;dinger &hellip; published a seminal paper defining and discussing the
        notion of <q>entanglement.</q> In the paper, he recognized the importance of
        the concept, and stated:  <q>I would not call [entanglement] one but rather <em>the</em> characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought.</q> Like
        Einstein, Schr&ouml;dinger was dissatisfied with the concept of entanglement,
        because it seemed to violate the speed limit on the transmission of
        information implicit in the theory of relativity. Einstein later
        famously derided entanglement as <q><i>spukhafte Fernwirkung</i></q> or
        <q>spooky action at a distance.</q></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The questions surrounding entanglement also concern what is meant by
      <q>measurement.</q> The wave function collapses upon <em>measurement</em>.
      Correlated-but-indeterminate properties of entangled particles become
      determined upon <em>measurement</em> of one of the particles. If we run
      a through a polarizer but don&apos;t place a detector of any kind on the other
      side, is that a <em>measurement</em>? If we pass silver atoms through a
      magnetic field and then out the laboratory window, is that a
      measurement?  Some influential physicists took the position that <em>noticing
       </em> makes the determination; that human consciousness is what makes the
      world <q>real.</q><!--Ball p. 91. Weizsaecker? Also, von Neumann and Wigner-->
      David Griffiths, author of <cite>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</cite>,
      calls such thinking <q>stultifying solipsism.</q><!--p. 383--> 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Wigner_interpretation"

        target="_blank">This interpretation</a> of QM, if it even deserves to be
      called such, has fostered countless books, articles, lectures and video
      programs that promote magical thinking while paying lip service to science
      (in much the same way that the <q>fourth dimension</q> was invoked in
      19th-century quackery, but on a bigger scale). Many careers have been
      built on <q><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mysticism" target="_blank">quantum

    <p>The <q>Schr&ouml;dinger&apos;s cat</q> thought experiment was intended to ridicule
      exactly this sort of thinking while at the same time pointing that it
      seemed to underlie the prevalent scientific point of view. If the box
      remains closed for an hour without betraying any clue as to what has
      happened inside it, are the nucleons of the atoms in the radioactive
      source in a superposition of inside and outside the nucleus, the atoms
      themselves in a superposition of decayed and not-decayed? If an atom in
      the box decays and is detected by the Geiger counter, is that a <em>measurement</em>,
      or is the detector now in a <em>superposition</em> of simultaneously
      smashing and not-smashing the container to release the poison? Does the
      cat choking on poisonous fumes constitute a measurement, or is the cat a
      system having a wave function that also is in a superposition of the dead
      and not-dead states? If a Dane in a lab coat opens the box and finds the
      dead cat but doesn&apos;t tell anyone, is that a measurement? Does <em>measurement
       </em> constitute an absolute change of state in itself, or is it relative
      to the context of some potential measurer or <em>observer</em>, as in
      relativity? This is the sort of philosophical nonsense that grows from the
      rich fertilizer of quantum uncertainty. This reminds me of something we
      will discuss in Chapter Thirty in the context of black holes, the seeming
      paradox of whether infalling objects become forever stuck on the boundary
      of such a monstrosity, as they supposedly do from the perspective of an
      outside observer, or whether they sail right on in, as an infalling
      observer is supposed to find. </p>
    <p>To say that the wave function collapses upon measurement, we have to
      designate some <em>boundary</em> between the system being measured and
      the system doing the measuring. As Sean Carroll writes<!--p. 113--> in <cite>Something
        Deeply Hidden</cite>,  <q>Crucial to the Copenhagen approach is the distinction between the quantum system being measured and the classical observer doing the measuring.</q> This boundary is sometimes called the
      Heisenberg cut. Heisenberg wrote of such a boundary, but allowed that its
      placement could be somewhat arbitrary. If one side of the boundary is
      supposed to be the quantum world and the other the classical, it isn&apos;t at
      all clear where that boundary properly belongs or even if we are justified
      in proposing that one exists. Some interpretations of QM reject the idea
      of the wave function collapse, and these are worth our attention. In such
      paradigms, there is no boundary between the quantum and the classical, no
      such distinction between measurer and measured. We will have a look at one
      of these in Chapter Thirty-Two.</p>
    <p>Maybe it&apos;s because mystery sells books, but what seems to be curiously
      absent from the endless stream of popular books about quantum mechanics is
      any discussion of whether the <em>exchange of energy</em> is a necessary
      and sufficient condition to constitute a <em>measurement</em>. If an
      electron passes undetected through a screen with two slits in it, no
      energy is exchanged. If it strikes a second screen and leaves a mark,
      energy was exchanged there. If we put an electron detector at one or more
      of the slits, the electron&apos;s presence can be made known only by the
      exchange of energy. The cat in Schr&ouml;dinger&apos;s box will die if and only if
      the Geiger counter detects the energy associated with the decaying atom;
      neither the life of cat nor the action of the counter would be in a
      <q>superposition of states,</q> though the atom might be.</p>
    <p>Einstein&apos;s <q>one last shot</q> taken at the Copenhagen school, which I
      mentioned earlier, is best known as the EPR paradox, after a 1935 paper
      submitted by Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. The crux of the
      EPR paper&apos;s argument is that if two particles with entangled spin
      properties are sent in opposite directions to two faraway observers (we&apos;ll
      call them Alice and Zeno) , either of those observers is free to measure
      the spin of their particle along whichever axis they might choose. They
      can even change their mind about which axis to measure the particle&apos;s spin
      on while it is still on the way to them, and they can change their mind
      after it is too late for either observer or (either particle) to inform
      the other of their decision of what will be measured before both Alice and
      Zeno have made their measurements. In other words, the measurements can be
      carried out in such a way that neither Alice nor Zeno knows nor can
      determine what the other will measure without violating relativity. Since
      this is one of Einstein&apos;s famous thought experiments, we are free to
      imagine that the entangled particles are sent simultaneously to Alice and
      Zeno at locations which are each two light-seconds away from a central
      source, and in opposite directions. Alice and Zeno agree that one second
      prior to the particles&apos; arrival, they will each push a button on their
      detector to randomly choose between measuring on one of two different axes
      of spin, and then they will measure the particle immediately upon arrival.
      Given the distance between them and the limits of the speed of light,
      there is no way for either of them to predict their counterpart&apos;s basis of
      measurement nor to report their own before both of them have completed
      their measurements. And yet, the fact of these particles&apos; entanglement
      means that those measurements must be correlated if they happen to be
      performed on the same basis, the same axis of measurement. If Alice and
      Zeno happen in one instance to both be measuring on the <i>x</i> axis,
      then their measurements must correlate. If both particles have the same
      spin, both Alice and Zeno must measure the same value of <q>spin left</q> or
      <q>spin right.</q>  If it later happens that Alice and Zeno both measure
      on the <i>y</i> axis, they must get the same answer then as well. The
      only way that can happen, per the EPR argument, is for both the horizontal
      and vertical spins of the particle to have some definite value at the time
      of their entanglement, despite the assertion of quantum mechanics that
      these particles cannot simultaneously have both spin properties any more
      than they can simultaneously have precisely-defined position and linear
      momentum. Such are the limitations of quantum (un)certainty.</p>
    <p>Were Einstein, <i>et al.</i> correct? I don&apos;t think I can render an
      unqualified answer on that, but instead I will describe the thinking and
      experiments that followed to shed more light on the apparent paradox.
      Whereas I have been writing that the question is whether or not quantum
      mechanics violates our concept of <em>causality</em>, the preferred term
      in discussions of EPR and entanglement seems to be the principle of <em>locality</em>.
      By using the term locality, there is an added emphasis on the assumption
      (or expectation) that the properties of a particle are 
      <em>located on that particle</em> as well as the expectation that a particle cannot
      immediately interact with particles that are far distant. Following EPR,
      discussion ensued over whether <q>hidden variables</q> &mdash; values that can&apos;t be
      directly measured but are nonetheless fully determined and in turn
      determine the outcome of experiments &mdash; might absolve QM of its appearance
      of nonlocality. George Musser identifies two key aspects of locality as
      follows:<!--p.5--></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Locality is a subtle concept that can mean different things to
        different people. For Einstein, it had two aspects. The first he called
        <q>separability,</q> which says that you can separate any two objects or
        parts of an object and consider each on its own, at least in principle.
        &hellip; The second aspect that Einstein identified is known as  <q>local action,</q> which says that objects interact only by bumping into one
        another or recruiting some middleman to bridge the gap between them.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In 1964, John Stewart Bell both vindicated EPR to some degree and ruled
      out the possibility of strictly local determinism. He wrote that the
      problems as described in the EPR paradox could be resolved by local
      <q>hidden variables</q> but then mooted the point be describing an experiment
      of a slightly different nature that would produce measurably different
      results depending on whether the properties of entangled particles were
      determined on a purely local basis or whether the idea of local
      determinism would have to be abandoned. Bell&apos;s Theorem, which was the
      central idea of the paper, rested on the premise of <q>Bell&apos;s inequality.</q>
      The logic of Bell&apos;s inequality isn&apos;t even subtle once you grasp it; it&apos;s 
      ironclad. If you take three binary properties (such as positive or
      negative spin on three independent axes) and divide a sample population (a
      group of particles, for instance) into one of six groups based on their
      yes-or-no answers to each of these three properties, then any two of these
      groups will have no less a population than the set that includes these two
      groups and two additional groups.  You can&apos;t have a <em>negative</em> population
      in any of the six groups. The <q>no less</q> part of that proposition is why it
      is called <q>Bell&apos;s inequality.</q> Bell then showed that quantum mechanics
      predicts results that violate this very inequality, reinforcing the idea
      that there are some properties that a particle <em>cannot simultaneously have</em> 
      well-defined values of. And then he proposed experiments to
      prove the point.</p>
    <p>In the decades that followed, experiments of this type have been carried
      out, proposing to look for loopholes of some kind and then ruling them
      out. Bell was right, and we have to reconsider our notions of locality and
      causality. There&apos;s something important that I think is missing from the
      discussion, and I will save that for Chapter Thirty-Two, toward the end of
      this book where I will reserve myself a place for speculation that is
      outside the bounds of my competence.</p>

      <i>The Walrus and the Carpenter</i> </h3>
    <p><q><i>The time has come</i>,</q> 
      said Rosencrantz,  <q><i>to talk of many things: 
        <br>Of castles, pawns and crooked knights<br>
            Who would be crown-ed Kings<br>
            And how the Queen is piping hot . .</i> . </q></p>
    <p>But this he recited to himself alone. He still hadn&apos;t worked out the next
      line. Outside the restaurant and bar now, he lit a cigarette as his
      customary signal that he judged the establishment safe to enter. Both of
      them former soldiers, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were expected to act as
      the prince&apos;s security detail for the evening. The place wasn&apos;t bad at all,
      but Rosencrantz could have done without the sand tracked onto the floor by
      tourists from the nearby beaches.</p>
    <p>Guildenstern opened the door of the party&apos;s limousine for Hamlet to get
      out, and escorted him to the door as the car drove away. He was exhorting
      the prince, whether to dispel his melancholy or secure a position of
      lasting import with him, it was not clear.  <q class="dialog">Let this moment in history be your opportunity as the architect of a <em>new Denmark</em>,</q> he said.
      <q class="dialog">And I shall be your loyal carpenter.</q> As they reached the door,
      Rosencrantz pulled his counterpart aside for a consultation. Hamlet
      continued on, regardless.</p>
      <p><q class="dialog">Take heed, and we may this night discover the mind of our prince and thus 
        complete our duty to the King. This have we learned, that upon the castle&apos;s 
    watchtower, did one of the royal guard bear Hamlet news that met him most
    ill. This intelligence we know not, but a <em>theory</em> have I, and I
    shall devise a way to try the prince&apos;s mind. Better still, I shall
    interrogate him by stealth, leaving him none the wiser. If his madness be
    the choler of vengeance, my test will be its proof. If he be driven to
    madness merely by grief, this trap will touch him not.</q></p>
 
    <p><q class="dialog">Vengeance? Upon whom and for what offense?</q> Guildenstern asked.</p>
    <p>Closer now, and quieter, Rosencrantz said, <q class="dialog">Young Hamlet may suspect Claudius of having murdered the king, his father.</q></p>
    <p>Guildenstern appeared for a moment to have found an epiphany in the idea,
      but verbally rejected it outright. <q class="dialog">Madness. Yours or his, it is madness.</q>
      He made for the door again, but Rosencrantz insisted on being heard.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Foolishness though it may be, that needn&apos;t prevent Hamlet from <em>thinking </em> it. Believe me or not, but mark you well his manner tonight.</q></p>
    <p>At last Rosencrantz clapped Guildenstern on the arm with one hand and
      turned toward the entrance, stubbing out his cigarette in the ashtray as
      he passed. He was looking forward to sitting down with a large platter of
      oysters, but as he caught sight of Hamlet again inside, he could see that
      the prince was already playing the fool. .<i>..And when her jester sings</i>,
      he thought. <i>No, that&apos;s mixing contexts. The rest are chess pieces,
        and of those, only the king and queen are playing cards.</i> He would
      have to do better than that.</p>

    <h3 id="ThreeThingsII">Chapter Twenty-Eight<br>
      Three Things About Gravity Which Are Not Quite True (II) </h3>
    <p>In the first (Chapter Sixteen) of this <q>Three Things</q> series, I discussed
      the common misconception that projectiles follow a parabolic path as they
      fall to earth, and hinted that I would undertake to debunk another common
      understanding of how gravity works, namely:</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;"> <strong>Heavy objects fall to earth no faster
        than lighter ones.</strong> </p>
    <p>Before I begin my arguably heretical attack on one of the more
      universally accepted <q>truths</q> in the world of science, let me make it
      clear that I will be talking about gravity and gravity alone. When I
      compare the falls of two different objects &mdash; a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C5_dOEyAfk">hammer
        and a feather</a>, for instance &mdash; let it be understood that wind
      resistance has been eliminated from the experiment. Let me also state that
      I will be discussing gravity as formulated by Newton and not the more
      precise and subtle theory of Einstein. </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>There is a mythology that accompanies the teaching of science, and the
      truth about one thing is often compromised for the purpose of making a
      point about another thing. One of the myths that I learned as a child was
      that long, long ago there was a wise man named Aristotle who asserted that
      heavier objects fall to earth faster than lighter ones. <q>It is obvious,</q>
      he said,  <q>how much more strongly a heavy object is pulled downward to the earth than a light object. Of course it will fall faster if released.</q> And
      for hundreds of years, everyone believed him. Then along came our hero
      Galileo Galilei, who had the audacity to question Aristotle&apos;s authority,
      and actually carried out experiments to determine whether or not Aristotle
      was right. He dropped two balls of different weights from the Leaning
      Tower of Pisa, and they both hit the ground at the same time. The age of
      experimental science was born, hooray! Or so goes the myth. The version
      you learned in your youth may vary from mine. The moral of this story is
      that experimentation and the scientific method can uncover truth that
      armchair reasoning cannot. And a fine moral that is. But the conclusion of
      the story is usually that  <q>heavy objects fall to earth no faster than lighter ones.</q> Period. And that is not entirely true, even though one is
      hard-pressed to find a science professional who will disagree in so many
      words.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/Pisa_experiment.png" style="max-height: 250px;"></p>
      <p><b>Figure 28-2</b>: Prior to Galileo&apos;s experiment, one might
        have reasoned that if a heavier and a lighter mass were dropped
        together, the heavier one would fall faster. Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pisa_experiment.png"

          target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Part of the problem is that the statement  <q>heavy objects fall to earth no faster than lighter ones</q> is too general and does not specify the
      circumstances of the objects falling. Are they dropped together at the
      same time, as contestants in a race to the bottom, as Galileo is said to
      have done? Or are they dropped one at a time with the duration and speed
      of their falls measured independently? The rest of the problem is that
      centuries ago, our theory of gravity surpassed in precision the limits of
      our ability to measure results in a controlled experiment. More on that
      subject will follow.</p>
    <p>Roger Penrose, in his introduction to a 21st century edition of
      Einstein&apos;s <cite>Relativity</cite>, wrote that we have known since Galileo&apos;s 
      time that  <q>all bodies fall with the same acceleration in a gravitational field.</q> Put in these terms, it seems hard to argue with. The <q>field</q> has
      the same apparent status as the law of gravitation, and all bodies would
      seem obliged to follow it. But the power of the gravitational field
      vanishes without the presence of a mass, and the acceleration of any
      <q>bodies</q> in this field is ultimately an interaction with such a mass.</p>
    <p>Isaac Newton gave us three <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">laws
        of motion</a>. One of them states that if you pull on something, you
      will be pulled in the opposite direction. This is why you lean away and
      dig your feet in when trying to drag something heavy on the end of a rope;
      otherwise you will end up tipping over as you pull. What this means for
      gravity is that as the Earth pulls downward on a ball, the ball pulls
      upward on the Earth. Furthermore, the heavier the ball and the Earth are,
      the more they will pull on each other. According to Newton, the force of
      gravity between the ball and the Earth is directly proportional to both
      the mass of the Earth <i>and</i> the mass of the ball.</p>
    <p>Now to my point. Imagine two stones, one weighing 1 kilogram and the
      other weighing 10 kilograms. The lighter stone is raised up from the
      ground and the Earth pulls it down with a certain amount of force. When
      released, that force causes the stone to accelerate downward 9.8 meters
      per second faster and faster &hellip; per second. Got that? After
      one second, it falls 9.8 meters per second downward. After two seconds,
      19.6 meters per second, and so on. The second stone is raised from the
      ground. It experiences a gravitational force that is ten times greater due
      to its mass being also ten times greater. But conversely, that greater
      force is acting on a greater mass, so it all balances out to a downward
      acceleration of 9.8 meters per second per second. Up to this point,
      Galileo is doing fine and things are not looking so good for Aristotle.</p>
    <p>But look at the other side of the problem. The lighter stone is pulling
      the Earth upward just the tiniest bit, and when it is released, the Earth
      will be attracted upward, theoretically shortening the time it takes the
      stone to fall to earth. The heavier stone will pull the Earth upward ten
      times as much, and so the time it takes to fall to the Earth will
      theoretically be even shorter. Even if we only consider the stone&apos;s fall
      before it actually strikes the earth, its fall during that time is
      accelerated by some miniscule but additional amount by the fact that the
      Earth is a tiny distance closer due to the stone&apos;s reciprocal pull on the
      earth. Aristotle was not entirely wrong. If we follow this reasoning, then
      the two stones dropped together will in theory fall to earth at the same
      rate, but both of them would fall even faster than either of them would
      fall separately. Galileo recognized this latter conclusion as a
      consequence of Aristotle&apos;s reasoning, but rejected it as well:  <q>What clearer proof do we need of the error of Aristotle&apos;s opinion?</q>
      <!--(Mazur 63-64).--> And in that rejection, in his utter dismissal of
      Aristotle&apos;s reasoning, he perhaps missed the insight that might have led
      to Newtonian gravity.</p>
    <p>Aristotle&apos;s error, in addition to having neglected the pursuit of
      experimental data, was not in concluding that heavier objects fall faster
      than light ones; it was in concluding that the rate of an object&apos;s fall
      was wholly proportional to its own mass rather than being dependent on the
      mass of the Earth as well. But even today, the subtleties of gravity are
      difficult to measure in the laboratory. The upward acceleration of the
      Earth to meet the small stone is nearly nothing; and the ten-times-greater
      acceleration to meet the larger stone &mdash; ten times nearly nothing &mdash; is
      still nearly nothing. To measure this <q>nearly nothing,</q> we would need
      equipment that could time the fall of the stone to an accuracy of dozens
      of decimal places. In the gravitational field of the Earth, the difference
      in mass between a sesame seed and a battleship is not very significant in
      determining the rate of fall of each. But there <i>is</i> an appreciable
      difference between the mass of the moon and the masses of man-made
      satellites. Whereas man-made satellites have no measurable effect as they
      circle the Earth, the moon pulls hard enough to make the Earth revolve in
      a measurable circle around the center of gravity (off-center but still
      within the Earth) that the Earth and moon define together.</p>
    <p>If we were able to stop the moon in its orbit, weigh it, and then time
      its fall as we dropped it on the Earth, we would certainly have fewer
      science experts telling us that heavier objects fall no faster than
      lighter ones. But then there would be fewer of us left to hear them
      anyway.</p>

      <i>Return to the Non Sequitur</i></h3>
    <h4>Scene I. The hallway outside the restrooms.</h4>
    <p>
      Guildenstern waited impatiently in the hall outside the Non Sequitur&apos;s pair
    of restrooms with Hamlet, who was leaning complacently with his back to the
    wall. Across the hall, one restroom&apos;s door had a sign on it indicating that
    its facilities were out of order. The door of the other opened, and
    Rosencrantz emerged from it, pronouncing the room <q>all clear</q> as he tucked
    away what looked like a pen-sized flashlight inside the breast of his
    blazer. 
    </p>
    <p>
      After Hamlet had entered the room and closed the door behind him,
      Guildenstern commented on the prince&apos;s sorry state. 
	  <q class="dialog">The world moves on, with or without us,</q> he said. 
      <q class="dialog">We must adapt to the times. I know not  whether the prince resents his 
		mother&apos;s marriage more or less than he  grieves his father&apos;s passing.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosencrantz reflected on this for a moment, then said, <q class="dialog">Each seems too much  
		entangled with the other. Hear me well, and I shall weave these with the threads which I 
		revealed to you earlier this night. I have it from the Queen that King Claudius was her first love. 
		He wooed her in the guise of a mere knight before his brother, God rest him, made her his bride. 
		She fears that Hamlet hath learned this of the guard that over the young lovers did keep watch in days 
		long past, and that Hamlet&apos;s knowing is the <i>sine qua non</i> of his continuing distemper.</q> 
		He drew a lighter and cigarette from the same pocket of his jacket into which the pen had gone. 
		<q class="dialog">Can you believe that? King Hamlet was ten times the soldier Claudius ever was.</q> 
		<i>And a score  what his son and namesake shall ever be</i>, he didn&apos;t say aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a scoff and a look of utter disbelief, his counterpart replied, <q class="dialog">Get out of here with your 
		<q><i>I have it from the Queen &hellip;</i></q></q> He blew a raspberry. 
		<q class="dialog">As <em>if</em> &hellip;</q> It was unthinkable to him that the Queen would see one of 
		them without the other. He doubted that she even knew which of them was which.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arguing the matter no further, Rosencrantz simply maintained eye contact
      with Guildenstern as he lit his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      <q class="dialog">How do you spell <q>knight</q> in English?</q> Guildenstern asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      For such a casual question, it appeared very much to have caught Rosencrantz off-guard. 
	  <q class="dialog">It&apos;s <em>n-i-g-h-t</em>, isn&apos;t it?</q>

    <p>
      <q class="dialog">Oh &hellip; Did you think I meant <q>night</q> as in '<em>the time after the sun goes down</em>' 
	  rather than <q>knight</q> as in <q><em>one sworn to the service of a lady</em></q>?</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      <q class="dialog">Do you mean to say there&apos;s a difference?</q> Rosencrantz asked with a worry that seemed 
	  unfeigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <q class="dialog">Do you not understand that as the essence of my original question?</q>
    </p>
    <p>Rosencrantz stood there saying nothing, but looking increasingly concerned.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Hesitation, one-love,</q> Guildenstern commented off-handedly.</p>
    <p>
      Rosencrantz swore and leaned against the wall as if in defeat, not pointing out that Guildenstern 
	  hadn&apos;t begun the game properly by serving with <em>Do you want to play questions?</em> But then neither 
	  did Guildenstern follow up by claiming a second point for the expletive, having made his last comment only in jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&apos;s silence, Rosencrantz speculated on what came next for
      the trio. <q class="dialog">Do you suppose that the King will relent in having forbade Hamlet&apos;s return to Wittenberg?</q>
    </p>
    <p>Guildenstern spoke as if the matter had already been decided.  
		<q class="dialog">Nay, Hamlet shall study instead in Copenhagen which is near enough to keep watch over him; 
			and where his madness won&apos;t be seen in him, for there the men are as mad as he.</q>
      <!-- http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/hamlet.5.1.html#153 --></p>
    <p>Rosencrantz called his bluff. <q class="dialog">His Majesty the King has reached no such conclusion; 
		you&apos;re just being petulant.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">You can&apos;t <em>know</em> that, because we&apos;re not <em>in Elsinore</em>,</q>
      Guildenstern shot back, proving the accusation. </p>
    <p>An instrumental passage from <q>How Many More Times</q> echoed down the hall,
      bringing Alice with it.</p>
    <p>As Alice approached the pair from the dining room, their argument grew
      loud enough for her to hear the words <q>Copenhagen interpretation,</q> 
      but she did her best to pretend she hadn&apos;t noticed the spat.</p>
    <p>Rosencrantz, noticing Alice, extinguished his cigarette, nodded to the
      restroom door and said <q class="dialog">Sorry. He shouldn&apos;t be much longer.</q> The
      schoolmates lapsed into a temporary silence, attempting to find anything
      of interest on the news-display screens of their wireless telephones.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">That&apos;s all right,</q> Alice said, and began studying the pictures on the
      wall. <q class="dialog">Oh my god,</q> she said.
       <q class="dialog">I hadn&apos;t heard.</q> On the wall was a memorial
      plaque and photo of the late celebrity scientist Eric Geller, known for
      bestselling books and television specials in which he dazzled his audience
      with tales of closed timelike curves, wormholes, and eleven-dimensional
      spacetime. Alice&apos;s gasp drew the attention of the other two; Guildenstern
      came alongside Alice to look. She was crying a little bit, perhaps due to
      the additional influence of alcohol and the emotional stress of having
      finally met Albert Einstein in person.</p>     <p>With a tone of devastated shock, Alice explained: <q  class="dialog">I can&apos;t believe he&apos;s gone. I read the hell out of all his books when I was younger, and I was absolutely mesmerized.</q> After a few moments, she burst out laughing:
         <q  class="dialog">But how absurd it all seems to me in retrospect. I have come to favor textbooks.</q> And after another pause, more quietly as if her words were
      meant for the picture alone: <q class="dialog">What a presentation you shall make of wormholes now.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Self-taught, are you?</q> Guildenstern asked.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Oh yes,</q> 
      Alice replied as she began to regain her composure. <q class="dialog">I much prefer self-study over private lessons. The endless recitations demanded by my private tutors used to give me nightmares.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">How splendid,</q> Rosencrantz said. 
      <q class="dialog">On behalf of the royal family, I would like to extend an invitation for you to come visit Elsinore when you may find it convenient.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Thank you, that&apos;s very kind,</q> Alice said.
       <q class="dialog">I &mdash;</q></p>
    <p>Then the door opened to reveal Hamlet who, upon noticing Alice,
      apologized not only for having made her wait, but for his earlier
      behavior. <q class="dialog">Please forgive me for having interrupted your dinner.  I am Hamlet, and these are Privates Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, soldiers of fortune,</q> he said with a perfect gravity that betrayed no sign of the
      group&apos;s <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/hamlet.2.2.html#249" target="_blank">in-joke</a>.
      Bowing slightly, he bid Alice <q class="dialog"><i>Adieu</i></q> before leading his mates
      back to the bar.  Hamlet&apos;s tie was clean, dry, and set smartly into
      place, but his shirt behind it had somehow gotten wet.</p>
    <p>
      As Alice entered the restroom behind them, Rosencrantz asked, <q class="dialog">Is everything all right, my lord?</q>
    </p>
    
    <p><q class="dialog">Yes, it&apos;s fine,</q> Hamlet replied. <q class="dialog">I was just checking on a friend.</q></p>
    
    <h4>Scene II (Version 1). A restroom.</h4>
    <p>Leaning down to inspect a limerick written on the bathroom wall, Hamlet
      listened to a recording informing him that Ophelia&apos;s wireless number was
      not taking calls at the moment.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>There was a good lady named Bright,<br>
          Whose haste was much faster than light;<br>
          She wandered one day<br>
          In a relative way,<br>
          And returned on the previous night.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Hamlet found no humor in the poem. In fact, it only increased his sense
      of dread; as an account of a woman vanishing into the past, it reminded
      him too much of his growing estrangement from the woman he loved. How
      shabbily he had treated her. Would she, too, belong only to his past?
      Further tightening the coils of anxiety constricting his heart was the
      hushed exchange he had heard between Rosencrantz and Guildenstern at the
      bar. What did they mean that he hadn&apos;t lost Ophelia &hellip; <em>yet</em>?
      What did they know of the matter?</p>
    <p>Next, Hamlet called his trusted friend Horatio, also finding only that
      the line was engaged. He then relented and dialed his number of last
      resort. Polonius picked up immediately.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">My lord,</q> the old man answered. 
       <q class="dialog">Where does this night find you and what delights does it offer?</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">I am at a library in Copenhagen,</q> Hamlet lied. <q class="dialog">Reading.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">What do you read, my lord?</q> 
      <!--[http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/hamlet.2.2.html#207]--></p>
    <p>Hamlet bent down again for another look at the limerick. <q class="dialog">Words,</q> he
      said, standing up straight again. <q class="dialog">Words &hellip;</q> His necktie, which had been
      hanging loosely about his collar, had swung forward as he straightened up
      and brushed against the writing on the wall. A spot of ink, still fresh,
      was now on his tie. <q class="dialog">Words.</q> He removed the tie and went over to the sink.
   </p>
    <p><q class="dialog">What is the matter, my lord?</q></p>
    <p>
      <q class="dialog">Quantum fluctuations in the fabric of spacetime, my good man. Matter is a wave.</q> 
      Hamlet quickly turned on the hot water tap in hopes of preventing
      a permanent stain. But a blockage in the spout resulted in lukewarm water
      spraying onto his shirt. He cranked the tap shut again and threw away the
      tie in disgust.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Yes, indeed a wave.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">And also like a particle.</q></p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Very like a particle, my Lord.</q>
      <!--http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/hamlet.3.2.html#369--></p>
    <p>Hamlet imagined Polonius rolling his eyes.  <q class="dialog">It is both and neither at once; everything loses meaning at the quantum level. To be and not to be, that is the answer. Speaking of which &hellip; </q> 
      Hamlet put his ear to the
      door to see if he was being overheard. Over Led Zeppelin riffs, he could
      hear the two idiots outside making a spectacularly dumb re-enactment of
      the Einstein-Bohr debates. Serious now, and as earnest as he dared to be,
      Hamlet asked, <q class="dialog">Have you a daughter?</q>
      <!--http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/hamlet.2.2.html#197--></p>
    <p>Horatio was calling Hamlet back now, but he dismissed the call, intent on
      hearing Polonius&apos; answer.</p>

    <p><b>Hamlet</b>: <span class="textmessage">just a minute. talking with the lord chamberpot</span>

    <p><q class="dialog">Words,</q> Hamlet answered with deliberate vagueness as he read Horatio&apos;s 
      message. Horatio next sent a copy of a message from Polonius, who had sent
      him a video and used the word <q class="dialog">indecorous</q> in urging Horatio to intercede
      and to spare the throne unnecessary embarrassment if he happened to be
      with Hamlet. <q><em>I do wish you would answer your phone,</em></q> he had

      Hamlet asked, <q class="dialog">Have you a daughter?</q></p>

    <h4>Scene III. The Dining Room and Bar.</h4>
    <p>Seated at the bar, Guildenstern echoed back the nonsense he had just
      heard.   <q class="dialog">  <q><em>Quantum fluctuations in the fabric of spacetime</em></q>? Please. Matter comes and matter goes, in a place and time of no-one&apos;s choosing? That can&apos;t possibly be true. Do you seriously believe that our very existence is governed by the <em>toss of a coin</em>?</q></p>
    <p>"Would you rather believe that all the world is a chessboard, with every
      piece having its moves prescribed? Shall you, as the king&apos;s knight, hold
      up your assigned square as a measure of what is true?"</p>
    <p>Between them at the bar, Hamlet appeared sick, and oblivious to the
      squabble.</p>
    <p>At the neighboring table, Zeno tried to see if his feeble German
      vocabulary was sufficient to amuse Einstein. <i>"Der gegen&uuml;ber mu&szlig; sich
        bald &uuml;bergeben</i>," he said quietly, nodding discreetly in Hamlet&apos;s 
      direction.</p>
    <p>Einstein responded with a wry smile and a shake of the head.</p>
    <p>
      <q class="dialog">&hellip; Heisenberg&apos;s principle correctly demands <em>rigid limits to
        precision and certainty,</em></q>
      Rosencrantz concluded.</p>
    <p>After a couple of drinks, Alice had felt brave enough to have a go at
    karaoke. She was at the microphone now, singing words of her own invention
    to the tune of <q>Anarchy in the U.K.</q>:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>I factor curl from speed<br>
          Frightful insightful deed<br>
          I know what I want and I know how I&apos;ll get it<br>
          I&apos;ll redefine passers-by<br>
          Iiiiiiii&apos; &hellip; gonna beeeeeeeee &hellip; a Ph. Deeeeeeeeeee,  no
          dogsbody!</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>I know my bras from kets<br>

          I know your crooked base<br>

          And Iiiiiiii&apos; &hellip; gonna beeeeeeeee &hellip; a Ph. Deeeeeeeeeee!! <br>
       </i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The audience reaction, among those who paid attention, was mixed but
      positive overall, with Zeno and Einstein leading a modest round of
      applause. After Alice stepped away and went to the restrooms to rid
      herself of the last remnants of stage jitters, Zeno and Einstein resumed
      their conversation. The next karaoke selection was <q>A Question of Time</q> by
      Depeche Mode.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">I have done some reading since the netcast I did with Alice,</q> Zeno said.
       <q class="dialog">Tell me if I have this right: When an arrow is in flight, it is measured by objects at rest (or in relative motion to the arrow) to be shorter from end to end. If an arrow one meter long could be shot at half the speed of light and were captured on extremely high-speed film next to a stationary measuring stick, the arrow would measure only 87 centimeters. By measuring the length of the arrow, we can calculate its speed relative to the measuring stick. Thus the paradox is resolved. If anything occupies a space equal to the space it occupies at rest, it is at rest. That which is in locomotion occupies a lesser space in a manner dependent on the velocity of its motion, and thus this velocity can be determined at any instant from the object&apos;s proportion.</q></p>
    <p>After a thoughtful pause, Einstein replied. <q class="dialog">Yes, I do believe that is correct. I have taken the opportunity to refresh my memory on your ideas as well, and it ought to be noted that you identified many problem areas that have gotten renewed attention in recent decades. In your Achilles paradox, we find an analogy for a Rindler horizon. In your dichotomy
      paradox, the infinite series. In the millet paradox, the seeds of the Fourier transform. In the stadium paradox, a suggestion of the forces on charged particles near an electric circuit.</q></p>
    <p>Zeno&apos;s face flushed with pride at this.  <q class="dialog">There are so-called paradoxes attributed to my theories as well,</q> 
      Einstein continued,  <q class="dialog">so you might say we have that in common. Not having thought the problem through, one may often find the predictions of relativity to be paradoxical.</q></p>
    <p>Alice returned to the table and sat down, delighted to find the two
      gentlemen still happily engaged in conversation.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      <q class="dialog">One such paradox is that of the long car and the short barn. A barn has doors on opposite sides and a car is approaching the barn at a fast enough speed that it contracts appreciably. The car at rest would be longer than the distance between the doors, but contracted in this way, someone in the barn could close the doors momentarily with the car inside and then open them again before the car smashes into the fore door. The apparent paradox is that the car should find the barn contracted as well and should not be able to fit inside. The resolution of this apparent paradox lies in the relativity of simultaneity. In other words, from the point of view of the car, the doors do not close at the same time and one door is always open. First, the fore door closes and then opens again; then as the front end of the car passes through the fore door, the rear door closes.</q></p>
    <p>Alice had heard this one before, and said nothing as Zeno marveled over
      it and Einstein brought forth his pipe.
   </p>
    <p>
      <q class="dialog">Another such <q>paradox</q> is called the Twin Paradox. Have you heard of it?</q>
    </p>
    <p><q class="dialog">No,</q> Zeno said, <q class="dialog">would you explain it for me?</q></p>
    <p>Einstein lit his pipe and did so.  <q class="dialog">This is the more famous paradox, and concerns two twins, one of whom leaves Earth for a journey in space at speeds near the speed of light. The astronaut twin returns to Earth to find that more time has passed on Earth than in his spacecraft and that the stay-at-home twin is several years older. I&apos;d like to embellish it now  with some characters that you will find familiar.</q></p>
    <p>
      <q class="dialog">Suppose that Achilles and the Tortoise agree to compete in a race to collect a piece of the rings of Jupiter and return to Earth. Achilles is able to reach 99.9 percent of the speed of light, while the Tortoise is able only to travel 50 percent of the speed of light. The race begins, and as Achilles leaves Earth orbit, he finds that space contracts in the direction of his motion and that Jupiter is closer than he thought. If it takes him a little less than half a minute to accelerate to top speed or to slow down again, he is able to complete the journey in only a minute by his own reckoning. He realizes that once he reaches his top speed, he can cover any distance at all in mere seconds because of the relativistic contraction of space. Knowing that the Tortoise enjoys no such benefit at merely half the speed of light, he decides to press his advantage and collect a sample not only from the rings of Jupiter, but from those of Saturn and Neptune as well. Having done so, he looks at his watch and sees that less than five minutes have passed since beginning the race. He returns to Earth with his trophies, expecting to revel in a spectacular victory, but finds that the Tortoise has returned several hours ahead of him, even though the Tortoise by her own reckoning was gone for hours.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      <q class="dialog">How is it that Achilles has lost this race? The answer is that having gone twice as fast as the tortoise, he has nevertheless gone several times the distance and must naturally lose. Though space has contracted for him, his clock has slowed down proportionally. An observer from Earth would measure that the Tortoise&apos;s journey lasted between 2 and 3 hours, while Achilles&apos; took the better part of a day.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      <q class="dialog"><q>That&apos;s fine,</q> you may say, 
	  <q>but from each contestant&apos;s point of view, haven&apos;t they each had zero velocity with
	   respect to their own frame of reference?</q> In the case of the twins, isn&apos;t it just as valid for
	    the space-going twin to suppose that she is stationary and the earthbound twin accelerates away and comes back?
		 In that case, shouldn&apos;t they age at the same rate? The answer is that the twins&apos; situations are not
		  equal, and neither are those of Achilles and the 
		Tortoise. Achilles and the space-going twin each experienced an acceleration much greater in magnitude and/or
		 duration than 
		their counterpart. This is what makes their frames of reference non-equivalent and allows us to designate which
		 of the two will age more quickly.</q>
    </p>
    <p>As Alice and Zeno listened, spellbound, the lone cloaked figure in the
      booth at the edge of the dining room sat sipping tea and reviewing what he
      had written in a University of Wittenberg composition book: </p>
	<blockquote> 
    <p><i>It grieves me beyond words to see my lord and good friend thus.
        Whether his madness be actual or feigned, I know not; neither could I
        venture to say whether he himself knows. He accuses all who surround him
     &mdash; all but me &mdash; of play-acting their
        parts, as if all of Denmark were a staged performance. His mother and
        father he believes to be insincere in their grief. The Lord Chamberlain
      &mdash; well, in this Hamlet can bear no blame, for all who
        know Polonius know him to be thus. Hamlet is convinced  &mdash;  again,
        quite reasonably, I must concede  &mdash;  that his two other schoolmates make
        pretense of friendship while they interrogate him on the King&apos;s behalf
        for any outward sign of suspecting the King in his father&apos;s death. Thus
        I, beknownst to him only, have followed the three men this night to
        watch over Hamlet as he strives to entrap them. Hamlet has confided in
        me his belief that by testing them in return, he shall also find who is
        the <q>author</q> of recent events, and his choice of words troubles me, for
        I know not whether by <q>author</q> he refers to his father&apos;s presumptive
        murderer or to something more indicative of Hamlet&apos;s belief in the
        falsity of all he sees, accusing even himself of dishonesty and
        acknowledging only in my confidence the part he feels he must act in
        order to discover the King. It may be aught but madness to believe that
        the future is written, but to believe its secrets vouchsafed to such as
        Rosencrantz and Guildenstern would be the very essence of folly. But no,
        he has done worse. Of all those whom Hamlet has come to distrust, the
        most undeserving is fair Ophelia. In this hath Hamlet descended either
        to madness or cruelty and it harrows up my soul to consider either
        possibility.
     </i> </p>
	 </blockquote>
    <p>The man looked up from his notebook as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern rose
      to escort Hamlet to the restrooms; the prince was to all appearances
      further gone than ever. <q class="dialog">Here we go again,</q> one of them could be heard to
      say. He got up from his table, keeping his back slightly turned toward the
      dining area and his face partly concealed. As the three men made their way
      from the bar, he passed the table where sat Einstein, Alice and Zeno.
      Hamlet then waved his friend away with a hand signal, and upon seeing this
      he took a deep breath of relief and took Hamlet&apos;s seat at the bar.
   </p>
   <p>After hours of conversation, Alice and company decided to call it a night.
    Alice excused herself to use the restroom one last time before hitting the
    road, but was interrupted by the man in the cloak, who had seen Hamlet take
    notice of her earlier that evening.</p>
    <p><q class="dialog">Good evening,</q> he said with a disarming smile.
        <q class="dialog">I just saw you and your friends in a usenet video clip. Would you like to see it? My name is Horatio, by the way.</q></p>
    <p>Obviously confused, Alice nevertheless consented.  <q class="dialog">Hello, I&apos;m Alice. Yes, um, certainly &hellip; ?</q></p>
    <p>Horatio dismissed an incoming call on his wireless phone, then used it to
      retrieve a video forwarded to him from usenet by someone called Polonius.
      In the clip, Hamlet stood up from the bar to face Alice and company, but
      couldn&apos;t be heard over the din of the room. At the end, Hamlet raised a
      glass to Einstein and swayed unsteadily.  <q class="dialog">He&apos;s the prince of Denmark, did you know that?</q> Horatio asked.</p>
    <p>Alice, having watched the video to its conclusion, answered <q class="dialog">Yes,</q> before
      excusing herself again as politely as she could while still being clear
      that the conversation had run its full course.</p>
    <p><i>I like her</i>, Horatio thought as he returned his missed call.</p>
