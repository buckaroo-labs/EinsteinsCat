    <h3><a name="Preface"> Preface</a></h3>
    <p>If the night sky is a source of wonder for you, this book might be for
      you. If, when you look up at the night sky, you pause to think about the
      different relative ages of the light coming from each far-distant star,
      and start to wonder about the very nature of time and space, this book is
      probably for you. The constellations as we see them are a matter not only
      of the relative direction of the stars from our standpoint, but of their
      distances as well, which affects the apparent synchrony of events in the
      heavens. The night sky as viewed from earth is a show that no one sees but
      us. </p>
    <p> Come with me for a moment, in your imagination, to Lime Kiln State Park
      on San Juan Island. In the northwest corner of the United States, Lime
      Kiln looks westward over the water at Canada's enormous Vancouver Island.
      In that water, if you come at the right time, you may catch a glimpse of
      the area's resident orca whales. They are large enough to be seen from a
      distance of several hundred yards even when little more than their black
      dorsal fins rise into view above the water's surface. Sometimes a spray of
      water from atop their head will accompany the sound of rushing air
      preceded by a dull thud, but over larger distances the sight precedes the
      slower-traveling sound, and the two are less synchronized. When this sound
      reaches us depends not only on when it happened but also on how far away
      its source is. In such circumstances, we might realize that the sequential
      order in which we experience events on the water depends on our vantage
      point, just as with the stars in the night sky. As above, so below. And we
      might start to wonder more pointedly about the nature of time, space, and
      reality itself. </p>

    <p>Again and again in physics, we see the role played by vantage point or <em>perspective
        </em>in our experience and our measurements. "Perspective" will be a
      recurring theme in this book, and was its working title for many years. </p>
    <p>There have been many proofs of Einstein's theory of relativity over the
      hundred years since it was finalized, but perhaps the most astonishing has
      to do with the satellites that support the Global Positioning System, or
      GPS. Just as Einstein's theory predicts, time passes more rapidly at the
      satellites' altitude, and if the engineers who designed GPS did not take
      this fact into account, the system would rapidly lose its accuracy.
      Shocking as this idea may seem, by the end of this book the reader should
      be able to see the logical consistency of it. </p>
    <p> The purpose of this book is to explain the mechanics of physical reality
      to a general audience, to the fullest extent possible. I have had a
      lifelong fascination with modern physics as well as a longstanding
      love-hate relationship with the process of learning it. I enrolled in an
      introductory course in relativity and quantum theory during my freshman
      year of college, but dropped the class almost immediately, finding that it
      had more math prerequisites than I was led to believe. It could be said
      that classical physics deals with sizes and energy levels that are within
      the realm of our day-to-day experience, while modern physics deals with
      higher energies and things that are either larger or smaller than we
      typically interact with. My more specific intention with this book is to
      bring modern physics, namely relativity and quantum theory, to a broader
      audience and to correct some popular misconceptions of it. My hope is that
      innovative use of visual learning aids will make this possible, also
      recognizing the needs of those whose sight is impaired. </p>
    <p>I can hear you asking, "But really, don't we already have too many books
      about relativity and/or quantum theory?" I get it. I have read piles of
      general-audience books about physics, and I can say with great confidence
      that you are unlikely to see anywhere else what I am going to show you
      here. I'm not expecting to advance theoretical physics here <em>per se</em>,
      just to make the teaching of it easier, to pull the mystery out of
      spacetime, and to call out the recurring nonsense that real science so
      often comes packaged with, even from respectable scientists. In Ron
      Garret's fascinating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc"

        target="_blank">presentation</a> on quantum entanglement, he refers to
      his comments as <em>the things that they don't want you to know</em>,
      "they" being the many authors who produce book after book in an apparent
      conspiracy to convince you how incomprehensible modern science is. That is
      the opposite of what I am here to do.</p>
    <p>This book is partly my presentation to you of some interesting things I
      have noticed, and partly my process of sorting out what I have read by
      trying to explain it. As the ancient Romans might have put it, <em>docendo
        discimus</em>; in teaching, we learn. There is beauty in the math and
      geometry of physics. I have every expectation of providing the reader with
      moments of awe and wonder, but never by misrepresenting the science. I am
      not here to start you wondering what secrets may be held in mysterious
      unknown dimensions; quite the opposite, in fact. I will encourage the
      reader to think less of time as a fourth dimension and I hope to better
      prepare anyone (who might be so inclined) to do the math related to what
      goes on in the three dimensions we know best. I'm not an expert on the
      science itself as subject matter, but I can say that my experience in
      seeing the ways that it is taught is pretty extensive. I have been badly
      misled at times by authors who knew better, and this has unnecessarily set
      me back in my learning process; I am determined to do better as a writer.
    </p>
    <p>When discussing the problem of presenting a difficult subject to a
      general audience, Einstein wrote: </p>
    <blockquote> Either [one] succeeds in being intelligible by concealing the
      core of the problem and by offering to the reader only superficial aspects
      or vague allusions, thus deceiving the reader by arousing in him the
      deceptive illusion of comprehension; or else he gives an expert account of
      the problem, but in such a fashion that the untrained reader is unable to
      follow the exposition and becomes discouraged from reading any further. If
      these two categories are omitted from today‚Äôs popular scientific
      literature, surprisingly little remains. But the little that is left is
      very valuable indeed. <em><!--(Barnett, p. 9)--></em></blockquote>
    <p>It seems not much has changed since Einstein's time. So much writing
      about physics for general audiences is pseudo-sci-fi or mystical woo-woo
      on one hand, or people who are hoping too much that the equations will
      speak for themselves on the other hand. Wikipedia's virtues are many and
      great, but for me its most frustrating shortcomings are found in the math
      and science articles, which seem to be written more as a refresher for
      those who are already deeply familiar with a topic than as a primer for
      those who wish to learn; in place of readily understood language, there
      are hyperlinks to other equally opaque articles. There's precious little
      skillful and detailed <em>explanation </em>to be found anywhere, and
      maybe that's a matter of supply and demand, but I am going to publish this
      and see who it helps. </p>
    <p>I don't remember who said it first, but it has almost become an aphorism
      that equations hurt book sales. Maybe that's true. But trying to write
      about physics using equations only when unavoidable is like trying to make
      a book about Shakespeare's plays without using very many words; no matter
      the depth conveyed by pictures, such a book would be unavoidably
      superficial. Like any modern guide to Shakespeare, I have done my best to
      provide a guide to unfamiliar terms for the reader, but really there's no
      beating the language that physics truly belongs in. So I have included the
      math for those who have the background to appreciate it, while doing my
      best to provide accurate translations.</p>
    <p>It is said that math is the native language of science, and that is truer
      nowhere else than in the subjects that are the primary focus of this book,
      which are called "mechanics" by physicists. The math of <em>classical </em>mechanics
      is easy to translate into stories, which are an important way that we
      human beings relate to the world. The math of <em>quantum </em>mechanics,
      on the other hand, seems to defy our efforts to assign a coherent story to
      it (I also <em>very</em> briefly considered calling this book <em>Story
        Problems</em>, which I would have found very droll, but it would have
      hindered the effort of finding an audience). I expect to remedy that
      situation at least a little bit here, as I show what I see as the intimate
      connections between quantum theory and relativity. As I have organized my
      thoughts to make this book, my role as a storyteller has become more
      clear, even though this is a nominally nonfiction work. That realization
      has been both inspirational and cautionary; I am excited about bringing
      meaning to the math, but I don't want to tell any stories that are both
      untrue and unenlightening. So I have set down guidelines for myself to
      keep the math close at hand during the writing process, to consult it
      regularly, and share it to the extent that I think the reader may
      understand it. With these guidelines, I am confident that I am less likely
      to go astray in ways I have seen myself and other writers do in the past.
      And the reader should keep in mind, as I try to do, that the math is
      usually closer to the truth, even if it is only our best approximation of
      it. The stories are just stories. Both the stories we tell about the world
      and the math we have used to describe it have changed over the centuries
      as we have noticed things happening in more predictable, quantifiable ways
      rather than at the whims of nature or deity.</p>
    <p>In telling these stories, some of which I have concocted myself, I will
      be taking liberties with some of history's great thinkers, placing them in
      fictional situations or borrowing the characters that they created to tell
      their own stories. One such thinker, Zeno of Elea (490-425 BCE) described
      several paradoxes which get to the heart of our conceptions of time and
      space. His first appearance here will be alongside Alice of <em>Through
        the Looking-Glass</em>, whose adventures are well-known (Lewis Carroll,
      the book's author, will be mentioned multiple times here). Alice's aplomb
      in the face of the strange, mysterious, and even absurd should serve us
      well, and her stories will serve as excellent metaphors. As to the
      heritage and rich history of other characters in this book, it will often
      please me to let readers make these discoveries on their own. </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Finally, I want to emphasize that my intent is to address audiences at
      many different levels of familiarity with math and physics. It is my hope
      that everyone will find something of value here, even if it means seeing
      familiar things in new ways. I also fervently hope that I can convince
      most readers to keep going forward, knowing that some of the things I say
      will go over their heads for now, being aimed at another part of the
      audience having some level of understanding which they themselves have yet
      to attain. Skip over what you must, reread what you wish to, and by all
      means please do return after consulting other sources. I will try to place
      signposts where the grade gets a little steep and where there are
      alternate paths through the text. I hope the journey is enjoyable. <br>

    <h3><a name="Acknowledgements"> Acknowledgements</a></h3>
    <p> I wish to thank everyone who has been kind enough to listen to me ramble
      about these ideas as they have developed, especially my family and
      friends. I am grateful to the Everett Writers Group for their feedback on
      some of this material. I remember the Burlington-Edison High School
      faculty with fondness: Monte Bianchi taught me perspective drawing; Reggie
      Nelson taught me geometry and calculus; and Dave Trout taught me chemistry
      and physics. The late A. A. Broyles patiently answered some of my early
      questions about relativity when he visited the office where his daughter
      and I worked. Cathy Plesko is both a friend and an inspiration, raised in
      the same tiny little town as me and now tackling problems like how to save
      the Earth from meteor strikes; her feedback has helped me along my way.
      Kelley Russ, whose article appears in the bibliography, was highly
      influential on my thinking, and I am grateful for his words of
      encouragement. The same is true of Ron Garret, who may be the first person
      to show me that quantum physics can make any sort of sense. Walter Lewin
      (MIT), Kenneth Lang (Tufts), Edwin Taylor (MIT) and David Nielsen (BYU)
      have likewise graciously responded to questions I have sent them by email.
      Murray Bourne (<a href="https://www.intmath.com" target="_blank">intmath.com</a>)
      gave me some helpful hints on the use of <a href="https://threejs.org" target="_blank">three.js</a>,
      which I have used to make some of this book's animations.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Speaking of which, I continue to be amazed at the free and open source
      resources made available by countless contributors, many of whom are
      anonymous. I would like to thank the people behind three.js, gnuplot,
      FireAlpaca, Wikimedia, and Wikipedia. Many of the illustrations you will
      find here are made available under the Creative Commons 3.0 license, the
      terms of which you will find in the links provided and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/"

        target="_blank">here</a>. Any such illustrations which I have modified
      for my purposes are available to you under the same terms. Wikipedia is a
      modern marvel, with staggering amounts of free expertise and lucid
      thought. Most of the content of chapter thirteen has been lifted right out
      of Wikipedia, and rather than apologize, I think it is more fitting to
      give an endorsement. MIT's OpenCourseWare program is a national treasure.
      The 3blue1brown and eigenchris YouTube channels have been particularly
      helpful and inspirational. Last but not least, I wish to thank the Khan
      Academy and Sal Khan in particular for being such an amazing resource; I
      can't think of any better way for an independent learner to get
      instruction on many topics in math and physics (and more). &nbsp; </p>

    <h3><a name="Intro"> Introduction: Schr√∂dinger and Einstein</a></h3>
    <p>The beginning of the 20th century was a revolutionary time in physics.
      Relativity and quantum theory have changed the way we think about space
      and time, cause and effect, and reality itself.&nbsp; One of Albert
      Einstein's scientific papers published in 1905 introduced his theory of
      relativity, and another paper that same year contributed to another theory
      which would come to be known as quantum mechanics.</p>
    <p>Of all the ideas surrounding quantum theory, the best-known is the
      thought experiment known as "Schr√∂dinger's Cat." As it became clear that
      physical processes on the smallest scales could not be measured without
      disturbing them, physicists began talking about the minimum level of <em>uncertainty
        </em>inherent in such systems. In the midst of this, Erwin Schr√∂dinger
      became uncomfortable with the direction that scientific thought was
      taking. Just because a property of a system is not measurable, he asked,
      can anyone really be justified in saying that the system has no such
      property? Because Danish physicist Niels Bohr was among those who insisted
      that such was indeed the case, this way of thinking became known as the
      Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory. In 1935, to make his
      objections to the Copenhagen interpretation clear, Schr√∂dinger presented
      Einstein with a thought experiment.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Wikipedia</a>
      summarizes his idea well: "A cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive
      source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor (e.g. Geiger
      counter) detects radioactivity (i.e. a single atom decaying), the flask is
      shattered, releasing the poison, which kills the cat. The Copenhagen
      interpretation of quantum mechanics implies that, after a while, the cat
      is simultaneously alive and dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees
      the cat either alive or dead, not both alive and dead. This poses the
      question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality resolves
      into one possibility or the other." </p>
    <p><img src="images/cats.gif" style="max-height:200px;float:left;">The idea
      of the cat being both alive and dead was never meant to be taken
      seriously. It was a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> argument against the
      Copenhagen interpretation, following Bohr's philosophy to its most
      ridiculous consequence. But it caught hold of the popular imagination:
      from Robert Anton Wilson's <em>Schr√∂dinger's Cat </em>sci-fi trilogy, to
      a popular-science bestseller by John Gribbin called <em>In Search of
        Schr√∂dinger's Cat</em>, to countless internet memes, this is the cat
      that will never truly die. </p>
    <p>In one hundred words or less, quantum theory is a theory about very small
      things; it is also considered a formal and precise way of describing the
      limits of how much information one physical system (an observer, for
      instance) can contain about another (the thing being observed). Whether
      it's the position and momentum of a subatomic particle or the decay of a
      radioactive isotope, we have to deal in probabilities rather than precise
      certainties. </p>
    <p>Though we haven't yet come around to thinking that way, the theory of
      relativity implies a degree of uncertainty in the physical world as well,
      due the the limits on how fast light is capable of transmitting
      information between one physical system and another. To convince you that
      this is so will take quite a lot of explanation; but for now, consider the
      following story, which may or not be true:</p>
    <p>It is 1935 and Albert Einstein has emigrated to the United States; he is
      a Jew essentially having lived in self-imposed precautionary exile since
      the Nazi Party took over his home country of Germany in 1933. On this
      otherwise unremarkable day, Einstein is visited at Princeton University by
      the anti-Semite industrialist Henry Ford, an admirer of Hitler who
      Einstein suspects has come to discourage him from again speaking out
      against Hitler's regime. Ford's reason for the social call, he says, is
      that he wishes to hear from Einstein's own mouth "the fundamental meaning
      and essence of your theory of relativity." Einstein takes Ford on a stroll
      through the woods near campus. After checking his watch, he begins his
      explanation of relativity by telling Ford that he received an ominous
      telegram that morning just before Ford arrived in Princeton. Back home in
      Dearborn Michigan, for reasons which are unclear and unimportant, a German
      agent has placed Ford's house cat in a sealed box. In this box are an
      alarm clock and a flask of poison gas. When the clock strikes noon, its
      alarm mechanism will shatter the flask, releasing the poison and killing
      the cat. "Mr. Ford," Einstein continues, "It is now three minutes before
      twelve o'clock. It is over six hundred miles to Dearborn by car. It is a
      ten minute walk to the nearest telephone, and perhaps five minutes of
      running may get you there. There is nothing within your power to save your
      cat from its fate. You will never see nor hear it alive again. If I can
      assure you that the situation is precisely as I have described it, is
      there any strict sense in which your cat is not already dead?"</p>
