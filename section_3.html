    <h2>Section Three<br>
      Three Shalt Thou Count</h2>
    <p> Every book needs a Monty Python quotation, doesn't it? I have chosen one
      for the title of this section of the book, in which I will include the
      third of my "Three Things About Gravity ..." essays and rest my case for a
      three-dimensional conception of spacetime. Four shalt thou not count. Five
      is right out (looking at you, Hermann Weyl and Michio Kaku).&nbsp; Whereas
      the first two sections were mostly informational, this section is of a
      more "editorial" nature. </p>

    <h3 id="ThreeThingsIII">Chapter Twenty-Nine<br>
      Three Things About Gravity Which Are Not Quite True (III) </h3>
    In previous chapters, we discussed some common misconceptions about the way
    that projectiles fall to earth, lamenting that gravity is still being taught
    using ideas from Galileo that could — and perhaps ought to be — replaced by
    the more precise Newtonian model of gravity. Certainly, a full mathematical
    understanding of Einstein's theory of gravity will remain beyond the grasp
    of most high school students for the foreseeable future, but if we wish to
    exploit Einstein's legacy to the fullest, we would do well to ensure that
    common education at least rises to the level of his great predecessor
    Newton.
    <p>Einstein himself failed to convey some simple and still-important
      Newtonian concepts in the presentation of his theory of gravity, even
      dismissing them in a way that may continue to cause some confusion for
      serious students, as Einstein's approach to explaining general relativity
      persists beyond his time. And so I introduce the third subject in this
      series of "Three Things," the so-called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle">equivalence
        principle</a>": the notion that </p>
    <p style="font-size: large;"> <strong>Gravity and uniform acceleration are
        indistinguishable. </strong></p>
    <!--    
 (Orzel, p.      195,197)   -->
    <p>Einstein’s general theory of relativity is often regarded as the crowning
      achievement of the greatest scientific mind in history. His name is
      synonymous with genius. It would seem arrogant for me as an amateur to
      criticize his writings. Nevertheless, after sifting through many textbooks
      and lectures, I have found some credible voices who have expressed
      criticisms similar to mine. Ironically, this is more agreement than I have
      yet found regarding the points I made in the first and second parts in
      this series.</p>
    <p>After publishing in 1905 his groundbreaking analysis of uniform motion at
      extremely high speeds, Einstein struggled for ten years to generalize his
      theory of relativity to accelerated systems. His breakthrough, he said,
      came as "the happiest thought of his life:" that if a person were to fall
      from a rooftop, he would feel weightless for the duration of his fall. He
      began thinking about the similarities between falling freely in the
      presence of gravity and being in a place where there was no gravity at
      all; and this thought process led to the completion of his general theory
      of relativity in 1915. When the theory was proven correct by astronomical
      observation in 1919, Einstein became an instant celebrity.</p>
    <p>Einstein’s "equivalence principle" — the idea that all forms of
      acceleration are functionally equal, whether they are due to gravity or
      some other force — is still taught in most introductory texts on
      Einstein’s general theory. The idea is that if you wake up in an elevator
      or some other enclosed space and have no way of looking outside, you will
      have no way of knowing for certain whether the floor is pushing on you due
      to Earth’s gravity or whether the elevator is accelerating upward through
      the shaft of a rocket ship blasting its way through space. Likewise, if
      you wake up floating in the middle of the elevator, you will have no way
      of knowing if the cable has been cut or if you are adrift in space.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Einstein once wrote of a man in a room-sized "chest," and a rope that
      pulled the chest upward with constant force through a space that was
      otherwise empty and not subject to gravitational forces. Feeling the force
      of the floor against his feet and seeing the rope attached overhead, and
      noticing that any items he lets fall will do so, such a man would
      reasonably conclude that the chest was suspended at rest in a
      gravitational field. "Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in
      his conclusion?" Einstein asked.<!--Relativity, p 88--> "I do not believe
      that we ought if we wish to remain consistent; we must rather admit that
      his manner of grasping the situation violates neither reason nor known
      mechanical laws. Even though it is being accelerated with respect to
      [another space], we can nevertheless regard the chest as being at rest."</p>
    <p>What Einstein and many science authors since his time have failed to
      mention is<i> </i>that there <i>is</i> a way to detect the presence of
      gravity in a space, and to distinguish between it and the kind of
      acceleration provided by a rope or the engines of a rocket. At least there
      is theoretically a way to do this, provided that gravity is strong enough,
      observations are long enough, measurement is precise enough, and/or the
      space is large enough. To accomplish this, we release a number of objects
      from rest at various points in the enclosed space (the chest or the
      elevator) and observe how they fall. It is not enough to measure <i>whether</i>
      the objects fall, for as we have discussed, this fall can be caused by
      forces other than gravity; one must measure <i>differences</i> between
      how the objects move. If gravity is present, objects on opposite sides of
      the space will drift apart; these sides will then be identifiable as the
      "top" and "bottom" sides of the space. If we draw an imaginary line
      between top and bottom, we will also observe that all of the objects in
      the space will contract toward that line. Why is this so?</p>
    <p>Though Newton’s law of gravity has been superseded by relativity, both
      theories agree that the strength of gravity diminishes with distance from
      the mass causing the attraction, and that the direction of gravity’s pull
      varies from place to place. And it is these two principles that are too
      often glossed over when emphasizing"equivalence."</p>
    <p>The answer to the previous question — why objects in a space which is
      affected by gravity drift apart in one direction and converge in another
      direction — is that gravity is non-uniform in that or any other space.
      Gravity is stronger at the bottom of the space than at the top, which is
      further away from the source of gravity; the objects at the bottom are
      therefore pulled down faster than the ones at the top, and the objects
      drift apart from top to bottom. Gravity pulls objects toward a single
      point (the center of gravity) rather than pulling all of them in strictly
      parallel directions; as the objects approach the center of gravity,
      objects at equal distances from the center will converge. These two
      related phenomena which make gravity measurable regardless of one’s frame
      of reference are known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_forces"><i>tidal
          forces</i></a>, and as you may guess, they are the reason the moon is
      able to cause tides on the Earth. The tidal forces surrounding a black
      hole are predicted to be so strong as to be deadly. An astronaut falling
      into a black hole feet first would eventually find that the pull of
      gravity on his feet would be so much stronger than the pull on his head
      that he would be stretched and torn. Among scientists, the short-hand term
      for this gruesome fate is "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghettification">spaghettification</a>."</p>
    <p>I'm going to say this again for emphasis: There is no such thing as a
      uniform gravitational field. Neither Newton's or Einstein's equations
      allow for such a thing, any more than Maxwell's equations leave open the
      possibility of a magnetic monopole: <em>∇&nbsp;</em> ∙ <em>B = 0</em>. </p>
    There is another "equivalence principle" often discussed in introductory
    texts in relativity, though it has been known since Galileo’s time. This
    other equivalence principle is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass#Equivalence_of_inertial_and_gravitational_masses">equivalence
      of gravitational mass to inertial mass</a>, which means simply that the
    amount of force required to accelerate an object is in direct proportion to
    its weight, and vice versa. Newton gave us two separate formulas for
    calculating mechanical and gravitational force, each of them having a term
    for mass, and it need not be taken for granted that the "mass" in one
    formula meant the same thing as the "mass" in the other. The equivalence of
    gravitational and inertial mass is not the equivalence principle which I
    intend to criticize, though in Einstein's mind both types of equivalence
    shared a connection<!--1916, p. 88-->. Rather, I wish to conclude this
    series of essays on gravity by pointing out some of the various ways in
    which physics educators support or contradict Einstein’s regrettable idea of
    the equivalence of gravity and uniform acceleration.
    <p>At one end of the spectrum are Chad Orzel’s statements that "gravity and
      acceleration are indistinguishable" (quoted above) and that "The key to
      understanding Einstein’s happiest thought is Galileo’s result . . . If
      there were any difference between the effects of gravity and any other
      force, some objects would fall faster than others and allow the falling
      observer to distinguish [between the two]."
      <!--(<i>How to Teach
        Relativity To Your Dog,</i> p. 203).--></p>
    <p>James B. Hartle, author of <i>Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein’s
        General Relativity</i>, establishes "the equivalence of uniform
      acceleration and a uniform gravitation field,"
      <!-- (p. 112)-->omitting any mention that gravitational fields are
      inherently <i>non</i>-uniform. Robert Resnick and David Halliday do
      likewise in <i>Basic Concepts in Relativity and Early Quantum Theory</i>.
      <!--(p. 292)--></p>
    <p>N. David Mermin, in <i>It’s About Time</i>, provides the disclaimer
      which Hartle, <i>et al</i>. do not: " The direction in which things
      accelerate under the Earth’s gravity is not fixed; it is directed toward
      the center . . . And the magnitude of that acceleration depends on the
      distance [from the Earth] . . . But if one is only interested in a region
      that is small on the scale of the whole planet . . . then the magnitude
      and direction . . . hardly vary at all. One <i>says</i> that the
      gravitation field is uniform. " (<!--p. 172,-->emphasis mine)</p>
    <p>It is valid to assert that Einstein’s equivalence principle is understood
      as being in the context of small extents of space and short durations of
      time. In such cases, tidal forces would not be evident. But this point of
      view is almost comical: "Gravity creates conditions just like uniform
      acceleration, at least in cases where it is so weak that some of its
      effects are too small to be measured." It seems a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Arrow_paradox">Zeno</a>-like
      argument, examining the flight of an arrow at instants in time and
      questioning whether the arrow is really moving at all.
      <!--Rant, top of page II:44--></p>
    <p>Bernard Schutz, in <i>Gravity From the Ground Up</i>, writes: "If
      gravity were everywhere uniform we could not distinguish it from
      acceleration. This is the sense of the word <i>equivalence</i> in <i>equivalence
        principle</i>. Therefore, the changes in gravity over distances tell us
      that we are really dealing with gravity and not simply a uniform
      acceleration. We will elaborate on this subject in Chapter 5 . . . "
      <!-- (p. 21)--> Schutz’s Chapter Five is entitled "Tides and tidal forces:
      the real signature of gravity."</p>
    <!-- <p>From Susskind lectures (IV:64): gravity is not really exactly the same as
      an accelerated reference frame, but it's useful to look at it that      way</p>-->
    <p>At the other end of the spectrum (and in contrast to Orzel’s statements
      above) are arguments that the ability to detect gravity’s tidal forces <em>falsifies
        </em>the equivalence principle to some extent. </p>
    <p>In the audio lecture series <i>Einstein’s Theory and the Quantum
        Revolution</i>, Richard Wolfson argues that tidal forces are the only
      real aspect of gravity and that all others can be made to disappear by
      making a change in one’s frame of reference (lecture 13). On that same
      note, Hermann Bondi said, "A gravitational field is a relative
      acceleration of neighboring particles."</p>
    <p>The equivalence principle is discussed as one of <i>Einstein’s Mistakes</i>
      by Hans Ohanian:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>It should have given Einstein pause that his 1911 calculation of the
        bending of rays of light, which was based on the Principle of
        Equivalence, yielded a result half as large as the new calculation based
        on the theory of gravitation. . . . For the physicist enclosed in a box,
        the implication is clear: the bending of a ray of light in an
        accelerated box is half as large as the bending in a box at rest in a
        gravitational field. This means that acceleration and gravitation are
        not interchangeable ‐ and the Principle of Equivalence fails!
        <!--(p. 226)--></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> He goes on to say, "Although Einstein was an avid sailor and sailboats
      were his favorite hobby, he ... failed to recognize that the tides
      undermine the Principle of Equivalence that he adopted as the cornerstone
      of his theory of general relativity. "
      <!--(p. 228-29)--></p>
    <p>A common problem in all three of the misconceptions I have discussed in
      this series of "Three Things" is the problem of measurement. In the
      laboratory, we find it a challenge to measure the miniscule difference
      between the parabolic trajectories predicted by Galileo and the elliptical
      ones predicted by Newton, or to measure the tidal forces which distinguish
      gravity from uniform acceleration. We are unable to measure any difference
      in the rate of fall of a heavy object as opposed to a lighter one.</p>
    <p>These challenges all arise from the weakness of Earth’s gravity and
      indeed of gravity in general. Gravity does not seem weak when it causes
      serious injury, but when one pits gravity against electricity or
      magnetism, it pales in comparison. A little bit of electric charge on a
      balloon can give that balloon the ability to defy the gravitational
      attraction of our entire planet. </p>
    <p>This relative weakness has the further consequence that we do not know to
      a high degree of precision what the strength of gravity is. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant">gravitational
        constant</a> used to relate mass and distance to force in Newton’s
      theory of gravity <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0034-4885/60/2/001">is
        only known to a few decimal places</a>. An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment">18<sup>th</sup>-century
        experiment</a> to determine the force between two masses in the
      laboratory gave results that were less than 1% different from the results
      of the best modern experiments. In other words, over two hundred years of
      improvements in theory and technology can only compensate so much in the
      measurement of an extremely weak force. Walter Lewin, at the end of his <a

        href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmJV8CHIqFc">first lecture on
        classical mechanics</a>, says that a Nobel Prize would be in order for
      any scientist who can experimentally demonstrate that the time for an
      object to fall is dependent on its mass.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>In this chapter we are going to pick up a couple of earlier threads and
      weave them together. In Chapter Seventeen, we looked at the geometry of
      curved two-dimensional spaces, and in Chapter Twenty-Five we learned that
      the theory of relativity explains gravity as curvature in a
      three-dimensional space and/or a four-dimensional spacetime. As promised,
      I will better explain what all of that means. </p>
    <p>Many texts on general relativity share Einstein's enthusiasm for the
      so-called principle of equivalence, and begin there. Having dissected this
      idea in the previous chapter, we should find it only of historical
      interest here. The true key to general relativity, one which Einstein
      himself seemed to regard as a mere afterthought, is found in the curvature
      of three-dimensional space. This is by no means the full extent of the
      theory, but rather our entry point to a true and intuitive understanding
      of it.</p>
    <p>To find our way through general relativity, we will approach its concepts
      in an order <em>reverse </em>of that in which Einstein worked through
      them. Einstein started first with a questionable but useful inspiration to
      regard gravity as indistinguishable from uniform acceleration (his
      Principle of Equivalence, which he called his "happiest thought"). From
      there he proceeded to the conclusion that clocks must run more slowly in
      accelerated frames of reference. Einstein based an early attempt at a
      theory of gravity on this difference in clock rates, which difference is
      now called the "curvature of time," an odd phrase if ever there was one<!-- (Brockman, p. 79; Schutz, pp. 225- 235)-->.
      This preliminary effort on Einstein’s part resulted in a calculation of
      the bending of light around heavy bodies that essentially agreed with
      Newton’s theory of gravity and gave only half of the currently-accepted
      value. Einstein needed to add the curvature of space to his formulas, to
      finally arrived at his theory of curved "spacetime." In our study, we may
      begin at the end; we are presented with Einstein’s brilliant solution of
      curved spacetime and given the somewhat daunting task to comprehend it. We
      will first find a foothold in the idea of curved space, the concept that
      Einstein included last. From there we will be able to work backwards and
      deduce the so-called "curvature of time," a consequence of curved space
      that turns out to be nothing more than Newtonian gravity; and as it turns
      out, we will need neither resort to Einstein’s equivalence principle nor
      to the concept of time as a physical dimension.</p>
    <p>It is relatively rare to see a professor write about the "curvature of
      space" rather than the curvature of "spacetime," but I find great teaching
      value in the former approach. It is simpler, easier to visualize, and
      thus, in my opinion at least, more powerful as a concept. In personal
      correspondence I received from a qualified professional, the "curvature of
      space" approach has been criticized as "oversimplified," and I cannot
      disagree inasmuch as I have yet to see it presented in the fullness of
      detail I will provide below. Kenneth Lang writes, "According to Einstein’s
      theory, space is distorted and curved in the neighborhood of matter. In
      effect, space has both content and shape. The curved shape is molded into
      space by its content, the massive objects." And: "Flat Euclidean space ...
      describes a world which is without matter ... the amount of space
      curvature is greatest in the regions near the object, while further away
      the effect is lessened."
      <!--(Lang, p. 217) --></p>
    <p>A common method of helping students to visualize the curvature of
      "spacetime" is to show a heavy object such as a bowling ball resting on a
      rubber sheet. The bowling ball represents a source of gravitational force.
      If a smaller ball, such as a marble, is rolled in the vicinity of the
      larger one, rather than continuing to travel in a straight line it will
      curve toward the bowling ball, perhaps eventually colliding with it after
      falling into the dent created by the bowling ball. While not without
      merit, this representation is unsatisfying for several reasons. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/Spacetime_curvature.png">
      </p>
      <p><strong>Figure 30-1</strong>. The ubiquitous, slightly iniquitous
        rubber sheet model of gravity.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>First, it relies on a presumed downward gravity to demonstrate how
      gravity is created by the distortion of the sheet; it would not work as
      obviously if the dent in the sheet pointed in any direction other than
      downward. If we rolled a marble toward a bump rather than toward a
      depression, we would expect it to curve away rather than toward the bump.
      Nevertheless, we are supposed to understand that gravity is purely a
      result of the curvature of the sheet itself, not its orientation in any
      other gravitational field. Only seldom have I seen the "rubber sheet"
      model used to better effect, showing for example that light cones embedded
      in the sheet are bent inward by the curvature of space surrounding a large
      mass; and this diversion is shown as being representative of the pull of
      gravity regardless of the orientation of the sheet.<!--(Orzel, pp. 231-32) -->
      However, this implies that the upward direction in the model corresponds
      to the future; this relates to another disadvantage of this model in
      general. </p>
    <p> Second, this model of gravity requires space as we know it to be curved
      along some additional dimension of space; part of the two-dimensional
      sheet is pushed along a third dimension to give it curvature. Are we
      thereby to understand that three-dimensional space curves in the fourth
      dimension of time? Or does it curve into some other fifth dimension? No,
      neither of these is the case, and some authors are careful to point this
      out<!-- (Wheeler, p.127)-->, though there are voices to the contrary,
      speaking of "a three-dimensional space that is curved in the fourth
      dimension."<!-- (Ferris, p. 197)-->&nbsp; Lawrence Krauss is among those
      who do not find a fourth dimension necessary to explain the curvature of
      the other three, but recognizes the difficulties in grasping such a
      concept: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> It is virtually impossible for us, who are confined to live within a
        curved three-dimensional space, to physically picture what such a
        curvature implies. We can intuitively grasp a curved two-dimensional
        object, such as the surface of the earth, because we can embed it in a
        three-dimensional background for viewing. But the possibility that a
        curved space can exist in any number of dimensions without being
        embedded in a higher-dimensional space is so foreign to our intuition
        that I am frequently asked, "If space is curved, what is it curving
        into?"
        <!--(Krauss, p. 56-57) --></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I think Dr. Krauss has grossly overestimated the difficulty in
      visualizing the curvature of which he speaks. And he is not alone in doing
      so.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Before going into the third reason I find the "rubber sheet" model
      unsatisfying, I will present an alternative. A topographical map shows the
      elevation at various points on the Earth using contour lines. These
      contour lines form closed loops and represent a continuous path where the
      elevation is equal. Where these lines are far apart, the land is
      relatively flat. Where they are bunched closer together, there is a steep
      grade. The map also has a grid of north-south and east-west lines that
      divides the map into squares. Because the boundaries of surfaces shrink
      when the surface becomes wrinkled, map squares having a greater density of
      contour lines contain a greater amount of surface area. There is more
      "area within the area." If you were to draw a circle or square around a
      steep hill surrounded by flat plain, you might say that the surface area
      contained by the circle is bigger than the area implied by the
      circumference of the circle or the perimeter of the square. Extending this
      concept to three dimensions, you might say that an enclosed curved space
      is "bigger on the inside than on the outside," a concept already familiar
      in science-fiction and fantasy which many students will therefore readily
      seize upon. </p>

    <p>This is the idea I prefer for visualizing the curvature of space: that
      three-dimensional space is denser in the presence of mass, just as the
      contour lines are denser on steeper areas of a map. But in the case of
      curved space, there is no hill rising upward, nor valley sinking downward;
      nor is there necessarily any fourth dimension into which the three
      dimensional space is bent. This model requires no preferred orientation to
      show its curvature, not does it require that the space’s curvature gives
      it extent in some additional direction. It only requires this small but
      highly significant amendment to our ideas of geometry as described so far;
      I will show some of the desirable consequences below, as well as some of
      the greater implications.</p>
    <p>Ironically, even though Hans Ohanian’s description of curved space is
      among the best I have yet seen, he also writes one of the more emphatic
      denials that such a thing can be visualized:</p>
    <blockquote>Curved three-dimensional space — or even worse, curved
      four-dimensional spacetime — is impossible to visualize. ... Some
      mathematicians claim they can visualize a curved three-dimensional space,
      but if so, they are crazy, that is, crazy in the sense of abnormal. The
      best a normal person can do is to visualize a curved surface, such as the
      surface of an apple or the surface of the Earth. Such a surface is a
      two-dimensional curved space which curves into the visualizable third
      dimension. The curved four-dimensional spacetime of general relativity
      curves into a fifth, sixth . . . or even a tenth dimension.
      <!--(Ohanian, p. 192) --></blockquote>
    <p>Ohanian’s expectations of what curved three-dimensional space should look
      like are burdened by the idea of additional dimensions — he writes, "If
      our three-dimensional space is curved, it must be curved into some
      dimension beyond three dimensions." — and thus he overshoots the mark, not
      seeing the full implications of the excellent analogy he himself provides
      for curved space: </p>
    <blockquote>[I]n a gravitational field, light propagates more slowly than
      outside the field. This means that in [this] regard ... the neighborhood
      of the Sun behaves like a large glass-filled globe encasing the Sun, so
      this glass slows the propagation of light. The glass is most dense near
      the sun, less dense further out, and it gradually fades away into empty
      space at large distances (where the speed of light resumes its standard
      [vacuum] value). Einstein recognized that such a slowing of the speed of
      light would bend rays of light in the same way that a glass globe bends
      [them] ‐ it bends rays of light that strike the right half of the globe
      toward the left, and it bends rays ... that strike the left half toward
      the right, that is, it always bends [them] toward the centerline.<!-- (Ohanian, pp. 189-90)--></blockquote>
    <p>If one sees that the density of the globe in this analogy is the density
      of space itself, then it is not difficult to see how the effects of
      gravity follow from it, as I will demonstrate. The bending of light rays
      that Ohanian refers to here is the same phenomenon referred to in Chapter
      Twenty-Six, where we considered Fermat's Principle (Figure 14-6 there, and
      Figure 30-4, below). As light passes from a less dense to a more dense
      medium, it changes direction.

    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> Gravity changes the "density of space," or the metric by which space is
      to be measured at one place versus another. The way that this change in
      metric results in curvature is different in three dimensions than it is on
      two dimensions, which should not surprise us too much after considering in
      Chapter Seventeen how two-dimensional curvature differs from
      one-dimensional curvature. The effect of gravity is to curve space <em>both
        </em>positively and negatively at any given point; the curvature in any
      given place will depend on the orientation of that plane. This double
      curvature results in the tidal forces that cause the parallel paths of
      freely-falling objects to converge in some directions and diverge in
      others. At a given point in space, gravity will cause parallel paths near
      that point to converge in the plane normal to the direction of gravity at
      that point, due to the positive curvature in that plane; and to diverge
      near that point in planes having a normal that is perpendicular to the
      direction of gravity at that point, due to the negative curvature in those
      planes. These curvatures are illustrated below.</p>
    <p>The idea that the same point in three-dimensional space can be a location
      of both positive and negative curvature ‐ depending on the plane being
      considered ‐ is analogous to the way a negatively-curved two-dimensional
      surface has two centers of curvature on opposite sides of that surface, as
      discussed previously. A two-dimensional surface may have only positive or
      negative curvature at any point, just as a one dimensional line may at any
      point on that line only curve toward or away from another point outside
      that line; but just as a two-dimensional surface may curve both toward and
      away from an exterior point, three-dimensional space may be both
      positively and negatively curved.</p>
    <p>Wheeler discusses this "double curvature" extensively in <em>Gravity and
        Spacetime</em> and provides equations quantifying the curvatures
      described above; the variously-oriented planes are treated by Wheeler as
      various sides of an imaginary cube having one side facing directly toward
      a (mostly) spherical source of gravity like the Earth. For each side of
      the cube, the curvature depends on the mass <em>m</em> of the source of
      gravity and the radius <em>r</em> from the center of the Earth. On the
      facing (toward or away from the mass) sides of the cube, the curvature is
      proportional to 2<em>m/r</em><sup>3</sup>. On the four non-facing sides,
      the curvature is proportional to ‐<em>m/r</em><sup>3</sup>. Curvature is
      thus positive on two faces and negative on the other four. Summing the
      curvature of all six sides, these equations neatly balance to zero, and
      the curvature is not surprisingly in units of density: mass divided by
      volume.<!--(Wheeler, pp. 88, 141-142)--> This pairing of sides — one pair
      of positively-curved sides and two pairs of negatively- curved sides —
      corresponds directly to the dimensions of space in which gravity acts: one
      parallel to the force of gravity, or "vertical"; and two perpendicular or
      "horizontal." The tidal forces tend to increase the vertical separation of
      freely-falling objects and reduce their horizontal separation in both
      horizontal dimensions.</p>
    <p>The illustrations below show the curvature on Wheeler’s imaginary cube
      sides, and as far as I am aware, they are an innovation on my part. A
      single black circular contour line, representing a fixed radius from the
      mass, is drawn through each cube side, though an arbitrary number of lines
      could be drawn in the same manner as magnetic field lines. On the
      non-facing sides of the cube, the contour lines tend to cross the side,
      and do so most clearly at great distances from the mass as the radius
      increases and the proportion of arc contained in the cube decreases. In
      these illustrations the radius is small, to show a case in which the
      center of mass is not far from the edge of the cube.</p>
    <p>A triangle is drawn in red between three points on the cube’s side. These
      points are connected by a representation of the shortest possible path
      between them. Since space is more dense on the inside of the contour line
      than on the outside, the paths that must cross this contour line are
      curved in order to lessen their distance through this denser space. The
      result is that the interior angles of this triangle are less than 180
      degrees. This side of the cube is thus shown to have negative curvature,
      as do all of the four sides not facing directly toward or away from the
      mass.</p>

          to the direction of the gravitational field.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>On the facing sides of the cube, the circular contour lines are centered
      in that side, since the center of that side is nearest the mass. Below, I
      have chosen three points on this side corresponding to the three points
      chosen above, and drawn the lines between them in blue, again representing
      the shortest possible path between the points. And again, since the space
      inside the contour line is more dense than the space outside, the lines
      curve to lessen their distance through that denser space. But in this
      case, that curvature results in the interior angles of the triangle adding
      to more than 180 degrees, and the resulting curvature is positive.</p>

    <p>Thus we see a third failure of the "rubber sheet" model of curved
      spacetime. The sheet is stretched by the bowling ball into a shape having
      only a negative curvature in the space surrounding the ball, and a
      strictly positive curvature where it contacts the ball; whereas the
      curvature produced by the gravity of such a mass is not so.</p>
    <p>All right, then, we have defined the curvature of space. But what is this
      "curvature of time" that is occasionally spoken of? One of its effects is
      that clocks run more slowly near a source of gravity than they do farther
      away from that source. But why do the clocks run more slowly near sources
      of gravity? The answer is found in the curvature of space that we have
      just discussed, and is best illustrated using a "light clock." As the
      clock nears a massive object, the space it occupies is more dense. The
      space between the mirrors is therefore greater and the path for one "tick"
      is longer, though the clock is stationary, and regardless of the direction
      the mirrors are oriented in. Because this same slowing is applicable to
      any process by which time may be measured, we say that time passes more
      slowly in regions of high gravity. The classical theory of gravity touched
      upon this idea by predicting that the frequency of light would change as a
      light beam progressed through different altitudes; Einstein extended this
      much further to connect time itself to the strength of gravity’s pull. </p>
    <p>The curvature of space gets us a little closer to answering the question
      of <em>why things fall down</em>. For any two masses at relative rest,
      there are numberless frames of reference in which they are both moving and
      the curvature of space would explain why their paths curve <em>toward one
        another</em>. This still leaves us a little at a loss, however, in
      explaining why their "paths" begin to converge when neither of them is
      moving, in that one frame of reference at rest relative to both of them.
      Maybe it's enough to suppose, as I did in Chapter Twenty-Five, that "time"
      is a basis vector that changes direction with time so that "up" vectors
      (or even zero-valued vectors associated with bodies at rest) eventually
      become "down," and "down slowly" becomes "down faster." The changing
      direction of this arrow, this basis vector, would be another sense of "the
      curvature of time." </p>
    <p> Or we might wave our hand and say that both objects, though stationary
      in space, are moving along the time axis of a four-dimensional spacetime,
      and those are the converging "paths." We would attribute the attraction to
      the "curvature of time" in this reference frame with the added effect of
      the "curvature of space" in all others. Maybe that's good enough for some,
      or maybe the idea only becomes satisfactory if by "paths through <em>time</em>"
      it is understood that we mean paths through one or more of the three
      dimensions of ordinary <em>space</em>, albeit on a sub-microscopic level.
      I will develop this idea further in Section Four, where I will also
      highlight some further quantum-mechanical considerations which make "the
      curvature of time" less necessary for our thinking and make it easier for
      us emphasize a three-dimensional curved space. Three dimensions of
      curvature I can handle, but four are beyond my ability to visualize.</p>
    <h4>The Schwarzschild solution</h4>
    <p>Karl Schwarzschild was the first to come up with a non-trivial solution
      to the field equations for Einstein's general theory of relativity. Like
      Hermann Minkowski, whose most famous contribution to science was in the
      context of special relativity, Schwarzschild died within months of his
      great accomplishment. Like the physicist John Henry Poynting, or the
      mathematician Elwin Bruno Christoffel (not to mention the famous plumber
      Thomas Crapper), Schwarzschild had a name suggestive of his best-known
      legacy. Schwarzschild is German for "black shield," and Schwarzschild's
      solution to Einstein's equation is what gives us black holes.
      Schwarzschild calculated the radius at which the event horizon of a black
      hole would form around a given mass, which is naturally named the
      Schwarzschild radius in his honor.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>"Black holes" were given their name by John Wheeler in the late 1960s due
      to the fact that light would be unable to escape from the interior of
      their event horizon due to the extreme pull of gravity at that distance .
      . . if, in fact, they exist. Evidence for the existence of such exotic
      objects seems to be growing, but the problem is philosophically a bit
      sticky, as we will discuss.</p>
    <p>The Schwarzschild solution describes the metric of spacetime in the
      neighborhood of a single, spherical, non-rotating mass. For any such mass
      <em>m</em> (even a bowling ball), there is a Schwarzschild radius, 2G<em>m/c</em><sup>2</sup>;
      if the given mass is dense enough to fit inside this radius (which in the
      case of the bowling ball would be ridiculously small), then this radius
      defines a spherical surface near which the math gets weird. In a geometry
      determined by radial distance from a point, it makes sense to use a
      radius-based coordinate system rather than a Cartesian one. In Chapter
      Seventeen (Figure 17-23), we saw the metric tensor for a flat,
      two-dimensional polar coordinate system. We need to work our way up to two
      more dimensions and add curvature to the mix. The metric tensor for a flat
      space of three dimensions in spherical coordinates (with <em></em><em>r</em>,
      <em>θ, </em>and<em> φ</em><em></em> standing for something similar to
      altitude, latitude and longitude respectively) is:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        three dimensions in a spherical coordinate system. <br>

    </blockquote>
    <p>And small distances <em>ds</em> in this space would be calculated as
      follows:</p>
    <blockquote>

        a flat space of three dimensions in a spherical coordinate system.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>For those of us that either don't remember or didn't quite grasp the
      lessons in Chapter Seventeen, I will translate. First, let's multiply out
      the matrix equation in Figure 30-8: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>ds</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>dr</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>r</em><sup>2</sup><em>d</em><em>θ</em><sup>2</sup><em>
          + r</em><sup>2</sup><em>sin</em><sup>2</sup><em><em>θd</em>φ</em><sup>2</sup><em>
        </em><em>= </em>(<em>dr</em>)<sup>2</sup> + (<em>r</em><em>d</em><em>θ</em>)<sup>2</sup><em>
          + </em>(<em>r</em>sin<em><em>θd</em>φ</em>)<sup>2</sup><em> <br>
        </em></p>
      <p><strong>Equation 30-1.</strong> The metric of a flat space of three
        dimensions in a spherical coordinate system.<em></em> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What this is saying is that in a spherical coordinate system, distances
      can depend on the radius or angle you are measuring from. This is similar
      to measurements in a polar coordinate system in which, for instance, if
      you are at the north pole and something in front of you takes up ten
      degrees of the horizon in your view, the width of that thing (<em>ds</em>)
      will be proportional to its distance from you (<em>r</em>) and that
      ten-degree width (<em>dθ</em>).&nbsp; This can also be seen in the way
      that lines of longitude get further apart as they extend from the pole,
      even though the coordinate difference <em>dθ </em>between them remains
      the same. For small distances, <em>dr</em>, <em>dθ </em>and<em> dφ</em><em></em>
      are perpendicular components of the vector <em>ds</em>, so their squares
      can be added to get the square of <em>ds</em>, using the Pythagorean
      theorem. </p>
    <p>Extending Figure 30-8 to a flat four-dimensional spacetime with
      coordinates of (<em>ct</em>, <em>r</em>, <em>θ, φ</em><em></em>), we
      have the following: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><img class="Figure" loading="lazy" src="images/ds-4d-polar.png" style="width:300px;">

        a flat spacetime in a polar (spherical) coordinate system.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The metric in Figure 30-9 is simply the Minkowski metric shown in Chapter
      <em>i</em><sup>2</sup> (Equation ii-5), but with the vector components in
      a different order (the time component is first rather than last, and its
      corresponding "-1" has moved to upper left from lower right in the
      metric), and with (<em>r,</em> <em>r</em><em>θ, </em><em>r</em>sin<em><em>θ</em>φ</em>)
      substituted for their Cartesian equivalents (<em>x,y,z</em>).&nbsp; Doing
      the matrix multiplication in Figure 30-9 gives us the equivalent of a
      familiar spacetime interval (Equation ii-1), but in polar coordinates:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>ds</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>dr</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>r</em><sup>2</sup><em>d</em><em>θ</em><sup>2</sup><em>
          + r</em><sup>2</sup><em>sin</em><sup>2</sup><em><em>θd</em>φ</em><sup>2</sup><em>
        </em><em>- c<sup>2</sup>dt<sup>2</sup>= </em>(<em>dr</em>)<sup>2</sup>
        + (<em>r</em><em>d</em><em>θ</em>)<sup>2</sup><em> + </em>(<em>r</em>sin<em><em>θd</em>φ</em>)<sup>2</sup><em>
        </em><em></em><em>- </em>(<em>cdt</em>)<em><sup>2</sup></em> </p>
      <p><strong>Equation 30-2.</strong> The metric of flat spacetime in a polar
        coordinate system.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now that we have the metric for a flat spacetime to make comparisons
      with, let's look at the Schwarzschild metric. To reduce clutter, I will
      represent the quantity (1 - 2G<em>m/rc</em><sup>2</sup>) by the capital
      letter S (just to keep from overusing the Greek and Roman letters, I
      wanted to try an Arabic or Hebrew letter here, but alas, my text editor
      gets really confused by letters from right-to-left languages). </p>

    <p>There's quite a bit to unpack here. The important thing to look at is
      what happens as <em>r</em> decreases to approach 2G<em>m/c</em><sup>2</sup>;
      2G<em>m/rc</em><sup>2</sup> approaches one and therefore S (1 -2G<em>m/rc</em><sup>2</sup>)
      approaches zero.</p>
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The time term&nbsp;<em></em>S(<em>cdt</em>)<em><sup>2 </sup></em>also
      goes to zero, and the radial distance term <em>dr</em><sup>2</sup>/S
      blows up because of division by near-zero. In effect, time and space
      become so severely curved near the Schwarzschild radius of a super-dense
      body that a satellite object approaching that radius (as observed by
      someone far away) comes to a near stop in both space and time. The
      incremental radial distances grow so large that they take a near-infinite
      time to traverse. Let's imagine a light clock falling toward this
      super-dense mass now. The metric of space is so distorted that the width
      (and height and depth) of this clock represents a distance so great that
      it takes a near-infinite amount of time for a light ray to cross it; the
      clock and time itself appear to stop at the limit of the Schwarzschild
      radius. at least as observed by someone not falling along with the clock
      and subject to the same changing metric. </p>
    <p>From our viewpoint far away from any such mass, we might expect that such
      distortions of space would prevent any super-dense mass from being able to
      contract sufficiently to completely shrink inside its own Schwarzschild
      radius and for a black hole to form. Such a process, creating a presumably
      infinite volume inside a finite radius, would take an infinite amount of
      time. The science seems far from clear on this point. Richard Wolfson says
      that there is a valid philosophical viewpoint in which black holes can
      never form because those of us outside of one would never see the final
      piece of material cross the event horizon.<!--II:46--> Leonard Susskind
      seems to think otherwise. I remain skeptical. </p>
    <p>A common argument around this point is to consider the problem from the
      reference frame of an infalling person. As you fall into the (perhaps
      nascent) black hole, your clock seems to be working just fine. Since one
      tick of your clock represents an eternity to an outside observer, you have
      no problem crossing what appears from the outside to be near-infinite
      distances. You cross the event horizon without incident. You have entered
      "the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns," and
      dropped off of the map of the rest of the universe. You have done the
      impossible and arrived at the far end of time and space, at least as it
      would have been measured by outside observers, who have long since
      vanished as their universe exhausted the last of its entropy. You might
      raise a glass in their memory before being shredded yourself by the tidal
      forces awaiting you nearer the black hole's center.

    <p>In this line of reasoning, the infinite distances encountered at the
      Schwarzschild radius are merely a problem associated with our choice of
      coordinate system; and comparisons might be made to similar problems in
      calculating the length of a curve that crosses the origin of a polar
      coordinate system. These assertions ring hollow when we consider that no
      one has ever been observed to be frozen in space and time near the north
      or south poles, nor would we have any reason to expect to see such a
      thing, as we would at the event horizon of a black hole. </p>
    <p>As helpful as I find the curved-space paradigm for understanding general
      relativity, it does not appear to be very popular. Is that because it
      doesn't carry the air of mystery that might sell more books? Even after
      piecing it together from clues left by Taylor, Wheeler, and Ohanian, it
      was easy for me to get nervous and wonder if I had misunderstood in some
      way. My mind was put at ease to find additional confirmation in <em>Relativity
        Made Relatively Easy</em> by Andrew Steane. After discussing a "hot
      plate" model of curved space reminiscent of Henri Poincaré's disk (Chapter
      Seventeen), Steane writes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We do not have to think of gravity directly in terms of curvature: we
        can think of it as an 'expansion field' which acts on an underlying flat
        spacetime (like the flat hot-plate) and influences all types of clock
        and ruler. ... With this point of view you have the right to insist that
        spacetime is utterly flat, but has in it a field (the gravitational
        field) whose effect is to cause time dilation and length contraction of
        all processes and all types of object by the same factor. ... [This]
        result is indistinguishable from a curved spacetime ...<!--262-63. See also 274, 276. V:88--></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>A non-Riemannian geometry </h4>
    <p>I came to my "contour map" visualization of gravity rather gradually and
      naively, beginning with the fanciful supposition that light passed through
      matter more slowly due to some mysterious distortion of space. I found my
      first encouragement in a draft manuscript on Edwin Taylor’s website (for <em>Exploring
        Black Holes</em>, a book he had developed with John Wheeler and was then
      rewriting with Edmund Bertschinger). Space, it said, is stretched in the
      vicinity of massive objects, even (in the case of black holes) outside of
      any event horizon. This idea became central to my understanding of
      gravity, and eventually the key for understanding its effects. But it was
      only in the preparation of this essay that I realized that the direction I
      have taken this idea may be considered an alternative to Einstein’s
      concept of general relativity rather than a concise explanation of it.</p>
    <p>I had naively assumed that my description of curvature in three
      dimensions was one of many possible Riemannian "manifolds," or perhaps at
      least a "pseudo-Riemannian" manifold, as Minkowski space is called.
      Instead, I found that Riemann had given as a postulate the very principle
      that I had discarded:</p>
    <blockquote>Measure-determinations require that quantity should be
      independent of position, which may happen in various ways. The hypothesis
      which first presents itself, and which I shall here develop, is that
      according to which the length of lines is independent of their position,
      and consequently every line is measurable by means of every other.</blockquote>
    <p>In Riemann’s system, space does not "vary in density." The distance
      between the mirrors on the light clock remains the same whether the clock
      is deep within a strong gravitational field or in its weaker outer
      reaches. Just as Euclid had postulated that parallel lines remain
      equidistant, Riemann proceeded on the assumption that scales of distance
      are uniform in a region of <em>n</em>-dimensional space. At first I
      worried that I had made a misstep in rejecting Riemann’s postulate, but
      then I realized that Einstein might have done so himself, had he gotten
      different mathematical advice. Special relativity was a tentative first
      step in this direction, making measured lengths vary between observers in
      relative motion. General relativity could be interpreted as having
      delivered the final blow in making lengths of measure vary between regions
      of stronger and weaker gravity. Though he may not have realized it,
      Einstein’s theory of gravity is most emphatically one of non-Riemannian
      geometry.</p>
    <p>In the Schwarzschild solution, the 1/S term of the metric tensor that
      pairs with radial distance <em>dr</em> is itself dependent on radius <em>r</em>
      (S = 1 - 2G<em>m/rc</em><sup>2</sup>). One can argue that the fundamental
      theorem of Riemannian space still applies with a negative element in the
      metric tensor per Minkowski, but with distances in the <em>r</em>
      direction depending on the value of <em>r</em> itself, the Schwarzschild
      metric is clearly "out of bounds" and describes a manifold of an entirely
      different kind.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This non-Riemannian geometry appears to correspond to the "shape
      dynamics" concept which Lee Smolin describes as an alternative but
      functionally equivalent theory to general relativity: "General relativity
      is more or less the opposite. Sizes of objects remain fixed when you move
      them around, so it’s meaningful to compare the sizes of distant things."
      In shape dynamics, by contrast,&nbsp; Smolin writes that "Size becomes
      relative and it becomes meaningless to compare the sizes of objects far
      from one another."
      <!--(Smolin 2013, pp. 168-170)--></p>
    <p>Interestingly, one of the earliest attempts to unify gravity with
      electromagnetism was based on a similar idea. In 1918, "Hermann Weyl
      suggested that this [unification] could happen through local variations of
      scale or ‘gauge’ in space," writes&nbsp; Stephen Wolfram<!--(Wolfram, p. 1028) -->.
      Peter Woit adds: "Weyl’s new principle of gauge symmetry allowed the use
      of different distance scales (or gauges) at different points. One could
      use a different gauge to measure sizes at different points, as long as one
      had a mathematical entity called a connection that related what one was
      doing at neighboring points. . . . Einstein quickly objected to Weyl’s
      gauge principle by noting that the size of a clock would change as it
      moved through regions containing electromagnetic fields."<!--(Woit, pp. 59-60) -->
      Weyl’s was not a bad idea; it was just not the correct application of it.
      General relativity is a theory showing the scale invariance of special
      relativity: the freely falling observer measures no change in the speed of
      light as space becomes more or less "dense," because the rate at which his
      clock ticks ‐ an indirect expression of the density of space ‐ must
      decrease accordingly. Wolfram also sees a three-dimensional interpretation
      of Einstein’s equations for gravity: "In their usual formulation, the
      Einstein equations are thought of as defining constraints on the structure
      of 4D spacetime. But at some level they can also be viewed as defining how
      3D space evolves with time."

          Einstein&nbsp; </em></p>
    </blockquote>
    I want us to do a thought experiment. It is January 1908, and somewhere in
    Lower Saxony there are two trains, each heading in opposite directions.
    Hermann Minkowski is aboard one of them, enjoying a hot cup of coffee. The
    rail line is maintained well enough that the movement of <em>Minkowski's</em>
    train in no way affects his ability to enjoy his coffee; at this moment, it
    does not matter that both he and the coffee are moving 60 kilometers per
    hour with respect to the ground. But unfortunately, the same cannot be said
    regarding the velocity of the <em>other </em>train, because it is on the
    same track, on a collision course with Minkowski's train due to a fault in a
    new electrical switching system. Tragically, Minkowski is among those who do
    not survive the crash.
    <p>The crux of this thought experiment, and the reason I ask you to imagine
      Minkowski's life having ended in this manner rather than due to a sudden
      onset of appendicitis one year later, is that he does not give his famous
      address to the 80th Assembly of German Natural Scientists and Physicians
      that September, and as a result, his concept of a four-dimensional
      spacetime does not become prominent. Let us imagine an alternate history
      in which some other formulation of relativity takes hold in its place, one
      in which it is not time <em>per se</em> but perhaps <em>velocity </em>which
      claims the role of co-partner with position in defining an invariant
      spacetime. Perhaps Einstein will grumble about this one too, calling it
      "superfluous scholarliness," as he did Minkowski's spacetime geometry.
      Perhaps he will even reject it and find another path to generally
      relativity, ultimately being satisfied only with a solution that includes
      an idea like Minkowski's. </p>
    <p>But how would this world look different from ours, a world in which
      something other than time was considered the "fourth dimension?" It will
      be interesting to consider the cultural impacts of this difference, but
      first of all let's consider some alternatives and whether they might have
      been plausible.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of Chapter <em>i</em><sup>2</sup>, we made time the
      fourth dimension in the invariant interval, and multiplied by velocity <em>c</em>
      to make the units come out right as a distance like the others. But is
      there any reason we couldn't have made<em> velocity </em>the fourth
      dimension and multiplied by a time <em>t</em> to make the units come out
      the same way? That's an entertaining thought, but when we consider that<em>
        c</em> must remain invariant while our measurements of time differ, the
      idea starts to look less appealing. When we have a vector space, we
      consider each of its axes to be associated with a variable rather than
      with a constant such a variable might be multiplied by. Furthermore, a
      velocity between any two given events really depends on the distance
      between them in an obvious way, and we like to keep our variables
      independent. Last of all, there's a nice symmetry between time and space
      on the one hand and clocks and meter sticks on the other. </p>
    <p>In summary, there are good reasons to pair position with time rather than
      velocity when pondering the mysteries of the universe. But smarter people
      than me have found it compelling to pair position with velocity's close
      associate, momentum. Hamilton elevated momentum to a place of primary
      rather than secondary importance in physics, making it fundamental rather
      than merely the product of velocity and mass. This distinction carried
      forward into quantum mechanics, where we find that position and momentum
      are deeply connected and that light has momentum without having rest mass.
    </p>
    <p>So maybe we can suspend our disbelief for a moment and think of a world
      in which spacetime is not three dimensions of space and one of time, but
      instead is composed of the usual three dimensions of space with those same
      three dimensions being reused as the fourth, fifth, and sixth dimensions
      of velocity. Or of momentum. If you can sit through Ant-Man and Iron Man
      doing time travel via the "quantum realm," you can bear with me on this
      for a couple of minutes. </p>
    <p>And that brings me really close to the point I want to make. How many
      time travel movies and books would we have in such a world? How ingrained
      would the idea of time travel be in a culture where "traveling the fourth
      dimension" was understood to mean nothing more complicated than going for
      a walk? As preposterous as such a thing might sound at first, consider
      that the set of all observers with a common velocity <em>v</em>
      experience the world slightly differently than the set of observers having
      a different common velocity <em>u</em>. Clocks run at a different rate,
      and measures of distance are not quite the same. These two sets of
      observers may overlap in all three dimensions of space, but in an abstract
      six-dimensional spacetime, they occupy different coordinates on at least
      one velocity axis. Depending on the coordinate basis used, they may occupy
      different coordinates on all three velocity axes. I don't think it
      unreasonable to speak of observers traveling along one or more dimensions
      of velocity when their movements accelerate and they change frames of
      reference. In doing so, they enter a world that is measurably different
      from the one they left.</p>
    <p>I like a good time travel story. Why wouldn't I? I enjoyed the Harry
      Potter series too, and didn't waste a single moment trying to figure out
      the theoretical basis of the characters’ ability to make things happen
      with the wave of a wand. But the problem with time travel stories, by
      contrast, is that they are too often regarded as science fiction rather
      than fantasy. And as such, they can get in the way of real learning about
      the relationship of space and time. Time travel offers the imaginative
      mind unique possibilities for adventure, narrative complexity, and
      righting of wrongs; it is no wonder that it is a very popular plot device
      and subject of speculation. As a consequence, by the time students are
      introduced to modern physics — namely the theory of relativity — they are
      likely to have several false preconceptions of time, accumulated through a
      childhood abounding in time machines, which make for great fiction but bad
      science. This problem can be exacerbated by educators who use terminology
      and analogies that reinforce these preconceptions rather than help to
      dispel them.</p>
    <p>The idea of time travel has become so pervasive that a book like James
      Gleick's <em>Time Travel: A History </em>was inevitable. Gleick writes
      that
      <!--p. 23-->"Time travel forces its way into philosophy and infects modern
      physics;" and that "We've had a century to think about it, and we still
      need to remind ourselves that time travel is not real. ... Every few years
      someone makes headlines by hailing the possibility of time travel through
      a wormhole ... I believe that these physicists have been unwittingly
      conditioned by a century of science fiction. They've read the same
      stories, grown up in the same culture as the rest of us. Time travel is in
      their bones."<!--p.  57-58--></p>
    <p>I am not an expert on any matter of science and am not writing as an
      educator <i>per se</i>; rather my area of "expertise" is in being a
      lifelong student. It is as a student that I write, my purpose being to
      point out what has been a great stumbling-block in my education and to
      advocate an approach to teaching relativity — and the relationship between
      space and time — that would have saved me a great deal of trouble. I will
      make some effort to make what follows comprehensible to a general
      audience, but this is primarily intended for those who are already
      familiar with the concepts, terminology, common metaphors, and
      widely-adopted diagrams associated with the teaching of relativity,
      whether as a student or instructor. For the experienced student, I hope to
      provide a remedy for the confusion that may have resulted from
      less-effective teaching; to the instructor, I hope to offer more effective
      methods. And for the theoretician, I may be able to offer a useful new
      philosophy of time.&nbsp; I would like to repeat some quotations from the
      beginning of Chapter Two:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> Lee Smolin writes: "More and more, I have the feeling that quantum
        theory and general relativity are both deeply wrong about the nature of
        time. It is not enough to combine them. There is a deeper problem,
        perhaps going back to the origin of physics." Smolin’s <i>Time Reborn </i>begins
        with over a hundred pages criticizing the current philosophy of time,
        denouncing its implications for a predetermined future and calling our
        failure to understand time the "single most important problem facing
        physics." One area of physics called thermodynamics, which we will get
        to later, seems to establish time as an arrow of some sort, prompting
        questions of why it only seems to go in one direction and why certain
        physical processes are never seen in reverse even though the math seems
        not to care which direction they run in. Einstein himself struggled with
        the concept of time, particularly with the definition of "the present."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> I will show that some confusion arises from the treatment of time as a
      fourth dimension, and offer an alternative that resolves many of the
      issues described above. I don't plan on arguing that there is no "fourth
      dimension" of time. I think that would mean picking a fight that won't go
      well for me. Instead, I plan to show that time as a fourth dimension&nbsp;
      — indeed, as anything more than an matter of accounting — is not as
      necessary as we might think for explaining special and general relativity.</p>
    <p>Lee Smolin's <em>Time Reborn</em> was published in 2013 just as I was
      coming to grips with the nature of time, and remains the most enlightening
      and insightful book I have ever read on the subject. I will be referring
      to it many times in this book. But it also contains many assertions with
      which I could not disagree more strongly, even though they do represent a
      point of view held by many persons of considerable learning. From the
      introduction to <em>Time Reborn</em>:<!--p. xxii--></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Einstein's theories of relativity make even stronger arguments that
        time is inessential to a fundamental description of the world ...
        Relativity strongly suggests that the whole history of the world is a
        timeless unity; present, past and future have no meaning apart from
        human subjectivity. Time is just another dimension of space, and the
        sense we have of experiencing moments passing is an illusion behind
        which is a timeless reality. These assertions may seem horrifying to
        anyone whose worldview includes a place for free will or human agency.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> This is <em>precisely </em>the viewpoint that I wrote most of this
      book with the intention to refute. Time is not another dimension of space,
      and the true meaning of relativity implies exactly the opposite of what
      Smolin describes above (and devotes a significant portion of his book to
      analyze). In the remainder of this book I will complete my arguments
      against this understanding of time, and consider a possible new paradigm,
      the likes of which Smolin demands over the course of his book but seems
      just short of recognizing or even dismissing. </p>
    <p>In previous chapters I have written that time as we generally understand
      it is imaginary in a mathematical sense; in the equation for the spacetime
      interval, it wants to be accompanied by <em>i</em>, the imaginary number
      (Chapter <em>i</em>). In Chapter <em>i</em><sup>2</sup> I clarified that
      it wasn't time itself that is imaginary, but rather its distinction from
      the three dimensions of space. But I'd still like to call this common
      physical idea of time "imaginary time," which will of course remain the
      most practical way of doing time-related calculations. <em></em>Imaginary
      time is thought of as linear and flowing in one (imaginary) direction; it
      could also be called proper time (Chapter <em>i</em><sup>2</sup>), which
      is time as measured between two local events. In contrast to imaginary
      time, I will introduce what I call "real time," which shares the same
      three dimensions of space and flows in all directions; and I will make
      clear the connection between these two conceptions of time. But first,
      some discussion of how we got here.</p>
    <h4>The early history of imaginary time</h4>
    <p>What I call imaginary time has a long history. We can see examples of it
      centuries ago in the form of a timeline. It's like the number line, but <em>events
        </em>go on it in <em>chronological </em> order<em>,</em> typically
      from left to right, from past to future. Already, this puts us on a
      questionable foundation. In Chapter Twenty, we saw that events do not have
      a strict time order that is universal. But if you're talking about the
      life of William the Conqueror rather than the History of Everything
      Everywhere, you don't really have to worry about that.</p>

    <p>"Timeline" is a popular science fiction term, and has a subtly different
      meaning, usually in the context of time travel. Sci-fi characters may fret
      over potential damage to "the timeline" or explore "alternate timelines"
      in which history unfolds in a different way from the history they know.
      "The timeline" is a dimension of an imaginary four-dimensional "space-time
      continuum."</p>
    <p> Mankind's long tradition of storytelling has always been inherently
      linear. "And the evening and the morning were the first day." "... and so
      Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat
      Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs." From storytelling has grown
      the science of <em>chronology</em>, the method of determining an <em>actual
        </em>sequence of events. All of our early measurements of time involved
      space in some way: the progression of the sun across the sky, the movement
      of the sundial's shadow; so the linear character of the timeline might
      seem natural. </p>
    In the seventeenth century, Galileo and Descartes got the idea of putting
    time on a Cartesian graph, independent of — and at right angles to — space.
    Orthogonality means independence; and mathematically, this is really sound.
    The way we think of time makes it completely independent of space. But
    ontologically, this is looking more and more like a wrong turn.<br>
    <p>Then William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865)<em> </em>promoted a new
      mathematical object called the quaternion, a concept related to (and
      eventually superseded by) vector calculus. The quaternion, Hamilton's own
      innovation, was four-dimensional, having three dimensions for space and
      one for time:</p>
    <blockquote>Time is said to have only one dimension, and space to have three
      dimensions. [. . . ] The mathematical quaternion partakes of both these
      elements; in technical language it may be said to be "time plus space", or
      "space plus time": and in this sense it has, or at least involves a
      reference to, four dimensions. And how the One of Time, of Space the
      Three, Might in the Chain of Symbols girdled be.&nbsp; <em></em></blockquote>
    <p>And where all of this unavoidably led was to the idea of time travel. H.
      G. Wells gave us the idea of the time machine in his 1895 book of the same
      name, and countless stories since then have featured similar devices. In a
      story that — interestingly — predates even the automobile, Wells' Time
      Traveller makes a clever argument that time is a fourth dimension in
      addition to the familiar three dimensions of space, and demonstrates a
      machine for traversing this fourth dimension. This particular
      four-dimensional understanding of space and time, which I will call <i>Wells
        spacetime</i>, still has a great hold on the popular mind, often
      becoming conflated with the Minkowski spacetime that was revealed not much
      later. </p>
    <p>"Any real body must have extension in <i>four</i> directions," the Time
      Traveller argues. "It must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and Duration."
      He makes the claim that "There is no difference between Time and any of
      the three dimensions of space except that our consciousness moves along
      it." He then goes on to cite the efforts of "some philosophical people" to
      "construct a Four-Dimension geometry" and points in particular to a recent
      lecture on the subject by Simon Newcomb, a real-life mathematician and
      astronomer who was at the forefront of the efforts that would eventually
      give birth to relativity. The Fourth Dimension was indeed a hot topic at
      the time <i>The Time Machine</i> was written.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Perhaps there would have been no <i>Time Machine </i>had it not been
      for the mathematician Karl Gauss and his student Bernhard Riemann, who
      more than anyone else was responsible for introducing the "fourth
      dimension" to both academia and the popular imagination. We looked in
      Chapter Seventeen at Gauss' and Riemann's innovations in non-Euclidean
      geometries. Riemann's system for describing such geometries was not even
      limited to three dimensions, which caused a great sensation. As Michio
      Kaku wrote, "Riemann’s famous lecture [on this subject] was popularized to
      a wide audience via mystics, philosophers and artists" and "the ideas
      originated by Gauss and Riemann permeated literary circles, the avant
      garde, and the thoughts of the general public, affecting trends in art,
      literature, and philosophy."
      <!--(Kaku pp. 62, 79)-->From there it wasn't far to Minkowski spacetime
      and light cones. </p>
    <h4>Relativity</h4>
    <p>Ten years after <i>The Time Machine</i>, Einstein's first paper on
      relativity was published, changing our understanding of the relationship
      of time and space, particularly at high speeds. Its essence is the
      declaration that all observers will measure light to have the same speed;
      the consequences of that fact are many, including that nothing can go
      faster than light and that observers may differ in their measurements of
      time, in a way similar to the way Galileo demonstrated that observers in
      various states of motion may differ in their measurements of distance. As
      it dealt with only the special case of uniform, unaccelerated motion, this
      part of Einstein’s work is known as "special relativity." Relativity
      directly contradicts Wells' concept of time, but has often been presented
      in ways which may seem to the lay person to argue in favor of something
      like Wells spacetime. Indeed, when surveying modern physics literature, a
      better-educated lay person may wonder to what extent Wells spacetime has
      kept an undue hold even on the minds of educators. Even the experts appear
      to slip into this mindset from time to time.</p>
    <p>Einstein's concept of the relationship of space and time has come to be
      represented geometrically by Minkowski spacetime (see Chapter <em>i</em><sup>2</sup>),
      named after the mathematician who proposed that Einstein’s relativity be
      understood in the context of a four-dimensional space. Einstein was at
      first unimpressed and "dismissed Minkowski’s formulation as excessively
      pedantic, joking that he scarcely recognized his own theory once the
      mathematicians got hold of it."
      <!--(Ferris, p. 197)-->Nevertheless, Hermann Minkowski's insight became
      key to Einstein's effort to generalize relativity to include gravity and
      accelerated motion. Building on the foundation of curved geometries
      established by Riemann and others, Einstein endeavored "to assign the
      fourth dimension to time and make the whole, complicated affair come out
      right."
      <!--(Ferris, pp. 199-200)--> Einstein’s "general relativity" was completed
      in November 1915 and published the following spring. We have discussed
      relativity in several previous chapters, but we will recap the highlights
      here as they relate to my latest argument,</p>
    <p>For those who understand it, special relativity destroys the notion of a
      universal time which is agreed upon by all observers in all locations. The
      whole of creation does not tick forward in unison in the way a movie
      progresses frame by frame through time, and thus it cannot be rewound and
      replayed. Due to Einstein's work, we now realize that events that are too
      widely separated to have any causal relationship cannot be meaningfully
      said to have any universal order in time. Different observers moving at
      different speeds and in different directions may measure such events to
      occur simultaneously or one after another, and in different orders in
      time; and this is perfectly harmless because neither event is capable of
      affecting the other. Though measurements of space and time may differ
      between observers, we see that one quantity remains constant no matter who
      is doing the measuring; this quantity is a combination of distance and
      time measurements between two events and is called the <i>spacetime
        interval</i>. In its simplest form, it looks like this (in all that
      follows, let us assume that units of time and space are chosen to make the
      speed of light equal to one, thus eliminating the need for the factor
      "c"):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <em>s</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>d</em><sup>2</sup> -<em> t</em><sup>2</sup></p>
      <p><strong>Equation 31-1</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This formula defines the interval <i>s</i> between any two events in
      terms of the spatial distance <i>d</i> measured between where the two
      events occur, and the elapsed time <i>t</i> between when they are
      measured to happen. It is a simple yet deeply meaningful equation and any
      student who finds it in a physics text will likely react with great
      enthusiasm after having been thoroughly intimidated by the much more
      complex Lorentz transformation formulas (Chapter Twenty). In science
      texts, the spatial distance <i>d</i> of the spacetime interval is often
      broken down into its components in three dimensions like this:</p>
    <blockquote><i>s<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>
        ‐ t<sup>2<br>
          <br>
        </sup></i><strong>Equation 31-2</strong>. <br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>An attentive geometry student may notice that this formula looks somewhat
      similar to the Pythagorean theorem, and indeed some texts will point out
      the similarity. Seeing all four of these right-hand-side terms in
      four-dimensional near-symmetry, it is tempting to suppose that the idea of
      Wells spacetime is therefore supported by relativity; that time is a
      fourth physical dimension at right angles to space. I fell into this trap
      for a time, and struggled to find my way out. Einstein's own description
      of relativity for lay audiences would have done little to liberate me from
      my Wellsian preconceptions. In <i>Relativity - the Special and General
        Theory</i>, regarding the difference between Pythagorean addition of
      dimensions on one hand and the form of the spacetime interval on the
      other, Einstein does make note of the difference but almost dismisses its
      significance. As he explains it, that pesky little minus sign (or the
      number <i>i</i> which makes the minus sign go away, as in <em>s</em>² =
      <em>x</em>² + <em>y</em>² + <em>z</em>² + (<em>ict</em>)²) is a matter
      of giving "due prominence" to the relationship between Minkowski spacetime
      and space as we know and see it, a relationship which he calls
      "pronounced." In this form, time "enters into natural laws in the same
      form as the space coordinates;" and thus "We can regard Minkowski’s
      'world' in a formal manner as a four-dimensional Euclidean space (with
      imaginary time coordinate)." He writes of the Lorentz transformations —
      formulas that enable us to translate space and time coordinates between
      observers in relative motion — as corresponding to a "rotation of the
      coordinate system in the four-dimensional world."
      <!--(Hawking 2007, pp. 72,223-224)--> Supporting that idea, at least one
      text on relativity uses an imaginary replacement for time to show how the
      Lorentz transformations may be derived from rotations in a Cartesian
      system.
      <!--(Dalarsson and Dalarsson pp.
      116-119)--></p>
    <p>This four-dimensional conception of spacetime is reinforced by Stephen
      Hawking, whose popular-science book <i>A Brief History of Time </i>sold
      over 10 million copies. In it, Hawking points out that though the orbits
      of the planets are elliptical in three dimensions, according to general
      relativity these and other freely-falling bodies "always follow straight
      lines in four-dimensional spacetime."
      <!--(p. 30)--> Introducing the idea of "imaginary time," he writes that
      for some quantum mechanical applications, "one must measure time using
      imaginary numbers, rather than real ones. This has an interesting effect
      on space-time: the distinction between time and space disappears
      completely. A space-time in which events have imaginary values of the time
      coordinate is said to be Euclidean[.]"
      <!--(p. 134) 143 too?--></p>
    <p>We are thus given the impression that physical reality is to be
      considered a four-dimensional Euclidean space, and the differences between
      what two observers may measure are merely differences in perspective due
      to their vantage point in this four-dimensional reality. In the sources
      quoted above, the distinction between "time" and "imaginary time" seems to
      be little more than a formality. But the distinction is an important one;
      the minus sign in the spacetime interval — or the "imaginary" in
      "imaginary time" — marks the difference between the "Wells spacetime" of
      science fiction and the "Minkowski spacetime" of relativity. Hawking
      states that one would presumably be free to travel both forward and
      backward in "imaginary time," though he says that the same ambiguity does
      not exist with regard to real time.
      <!--(Hawking 1990, pp.
      143-144)--> What Hawking would call imaginary time, I would call real
      time, and vice versa. Throughout this chapter, I will build the case for
      an "imaginary time" as being something linear that flows in only one
      direction, somehow separate and distinct from the three dimensions of
      space; and for a "real time" as something that extends in the same three
      dimensions of space and goes in all directions of it. </p>
    <!--  <p>Wells spacetime appears in most ‐ if not all ‐ books discussing
      relativity. John Archibald Wheeler uses it to show the congruence of the      paths of a fast and a slow ball on separate trajectories ‐ one mostly      straight and another arcing ‐ between two points.    (Wheeler, p. 28-29) Any graph showing time as      perpendicular to space is <i>ipso facto</i> a diagram of Wells      spacetime.&nbsp; </p>-->
    <p>From the beginning, Minkowski spacetime has been pervasively conflated
      with Wells spacetime, in some cases leading to the viewpoint that the
      future is unchangeable. For example, the physicist and mathematician
      Hermann Weyl, a contemporary of Einstein’s mentioned already in Chapter
      Thirty, echoed the assertion of Wells’ Time Traveller that "There is no
      difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of space except
      that our consciousness moves along it." According to Weyl, </p>
    <blockquote>The objective world simply <i>is</i>; it does not <i>happen</i>.
      Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along the world line
      of my body, does a section of the world come to life as a fleeting image
      in space which continuously changes in time.<!-- <em>(Smolin
        2013, p. 61)--></blockquote>
    <p>Gleick, as astonished as I am, notes that this Wellsian idea of time has
      become "part of the orthodoxy of theoretical physics."
      <!--TT, p. 8-->What would this mean regarding free will? Are we active
      participants in the unfolding of time, or do we incrementally experience a
      future that is determined by the present (and thus by the past)? Because
      graphing time against space (as in Figure 2-3) allows us to present time
      as a <em>dimension </em>which we can examine from an outside
      perspective, and thus gives us a view of a fixed eternity, theoretical
      physicist Lee Smolin calls Galileo’s and Descartes’ innovation in using
      such graphs "the scene of the crime."
      <!--(Smolin 2006, p.
      257)-->Likewise, light cones are extraordinary teaching tools, but as they
      show time as perpendicular to space, they could be considered a
      representation of Wells spacetime rather than Minkowski spacetime or of
      what I would call "real spacetime." I am going to put the next sentence in
      bold type, in its own paragraph, to emphasize its importance.</p>
    <blockquote> <b>The non-universality of past, present, and future is the
        essence of special relativity; the four-dimensional constructs that we
        use to visualize it are <i>not</i>.
        <!-- see IV:22 on why 4D makes so much sense --> </b>
      <!-- Mazur 185. two quotations at bottom of my III-11) --> </blockquote>
    <p>"Dimension" is perhaps too familiar a term for newcomers to relativity,
      carrying with it connotations that are not appropriate when referring to
      time. Time as a "coordinate" is arguably less loaded with such
      connotations. In the highly popular book <i>Hyperspace</i>, Michio Kaku
      writes of time as a dimension, emphasizing its distinction as a <i>temporal</i>
      dimension, but placing it in a context that can be truly unfortunate for
      the uncritical reader. This regrettable context is Kaku's discussions of
      time travel in a universe which he speculates may have as many as nine
      physical dimensions. He makes an unfortunate segue from a discussion of
      four-dimensional spacetime to one of three-dimensional space possibly
      being multiply connected due to a fourth dimension.
      <!-- (pp. 94-95) -->Kaku’s central theme appears to be that "more is
      better" in terms of dimensions being used to explain the physical world;
      my thesis here is that Kaku’s point of view — shared by many others — may
      be preventing us from seeing all that is possible with the visible,
      familiar three dimensions. It is too seldom that Minkowski spacetime is
      presented with strong cautions that it is "just a man-made scheme for
      understanding the world through mathematics" (Joseph Mazur<!--, p. 185-->)
      rather than a God’s-eye view of eternity; it is "a mathematical device"
      that is not meant to "imply that space and time are now to be regarded as
      basically similar physical quantities" (D. F. Lawden<!--, pp. 8,11-->).</p>
    <p>As I recall, my motivation to abandon the idea of Wells spacetime came
      not from the reading of textbooks but from an <a href="http://www.friesian.com/curved-1.htm">article</a>
      I found on the internet called "The Ontology and Cosmology of
      Non-Euclidean Geometry." One sentence in particular made an impression on
      me: "Just because the math works doesn't mean that we understand what is
      happening in nature." In other words, just because you can draw a graph of
      something doesn’t mean that the resulting physical shape exists in any
      other sense. Lee Smolin has recently written a similar caution:</p>
    <blockquote>The pragmatist will argue that there’s nothing wrong with
      checking hypotheses about laws of motion by converting motion into numbers
      in tables and looking for patterns in those tables. But the pragmatist
      will insist that the mathematical representation of motion as a curve does
      not imply that the motion is in any way identical to the representation.
      The very fact that the motion takes place in time whereas its mathematical
      representation is timeless [in the sense of being viewed from outside
      time] means they aren’t the same thing.
      <!--(Smolin 2013, p.
        24)--></blockquote>
    <p>Consider the following statement: "Since time is one-dimensional (the
      history of Rome, for instance, can be ordered on a single line) and space
      has three dimensions, their combination is a four-dimensional realm."
      (Bernard Schutz<!--, p. 214-->) This brings us to the heart of the matter.
      Mathematically, events must be treated as having four coordinates; to
      identify them fully, one must specify a time coordinate as well as three
      coordinates of space. But the physical reality in which those events occur
      is <em>three</em>-dimensional; time is measured by observing events that
      unfold in one or more of the three dimensions of space, such as the
      back-and-forth reflection of a light beam between two parallel mirrors
      that form the "light clock" spoken of in Chapter Twenty.</p>
    <p>I eventually began to see, as Lincoln Barnett put it: "All measurements
      of time are really measurements of space."
      <!--(Cole, pp. 134-35) (II:67. Must reread whole book)-->In what seemed
      like a great revelation to me, I realized that time was ‐ in a very
      important sense ‐ a <i>radial measurement from the observer</i>, with
      "here" corresponding to "now," and "there" corresponding to "then." I can
      touch and be touched, affect and be affected <i>now</i> by things that
      are <i>here</i>. I cannot affect nor be affected by things that are <i>there
        </i>until<i> later</i>. They cannot affect me nor can I affect them now,
      for we are beyond one another’s immediate reach. I see my own body as it
      is now, or at least very close to now; I see the stars as they were long
      ago. This is true in a very quantitative way: when I look at the night
      sky, what I see now are events that are one light year away and one year
      old, four light years away and four years old, eight light years away and
      eight years old, and so on. The events I see now that are sixteen years
      old originated in a sphere that has a radius of sixteen light years. Even
      on a small scale, light from events that occur ten feet away will not
      reach me for ten nanoseconds, though this lag is much too small for human
      beings to notice. Thus I say that physically, time can be considered a
      radial measurement <i>within the three dimensions of space</i>.</p>
    <p>Some may object to this idea that time is contained in space rather than
      being apart from it. In an imaginary dialog with his pet, one physicist
      writes: "I said that time and space were different aspects of the same
      thing, not that they were identical. They’re obviously different, because
      you can only move forward through time, not backwards." (Chad Orzel<!--, pp. 108-109-->)
      There is a flaw in this argument, in that it can be made analogous to
      imagining oneself at the north pole and saying that the dimension of
      "north-south" is different from the two dimensions of the Earth’s surface
      because one can only travel in the "south" direction from there. North and
      south are radial from the observer at the north pole, just as time can be
      seen as radial from the observer in space. It is neither "this way" nor
      "that way"; it is merely "outward" or "inward." A universal system that is
      unbiased toward any observer must ignore this radial aspect and thus is
      not surprisingly four-dimensional. Though useful, it does not correspond
      to nor contain the perspective of any single observer.</p>
    <p>As Joseph Mazur writes, "If all motion were to cease in the universe for
      an interval of time, what could we possibly mean by that interval? If
      motion is not taking place, then the time span of the interval is not
      either . . . every time interval must represent the motion of something in
      the universe."
      <!--(Mazur, p. 37)-->And by inference, every interval of time must
      represent the distance which that "something" transits.</p>
    <p>The idea that spacetime is three-dimensional in this physical sense need
      not be considered contradictory to the fact that physical events
      meaningfully occupy a mathematical, four-dimensional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space"><i>vector
          space</i></a>, which is a term familiar to those who have studied
      linear algebra. The four dimensions of spacetime might be considered
      analogous to the four dimensions of a demographic analysis that includes
      age, income, weight, and resting heart rate. Each person would occupy a
      single point in this "space," measured along four numerical coordinates
      that are not necessarily related nor fully independent of one another,
      just as time is not fully independent of space. Quantum physics deals in
      vector spaces of any number of dimensions, which need not correspond to
      any coordinate in space or time.</p>
    <p>The spacetime interval is presented as a consistent "measuring stick" for
      four-dimensional spacetime, but what exactly is it measuring? The curious
      nature of the spacetime interval — and the Minkowski spacetime that it
      measures — is most evident in the fact that the interval between events
      widely separated in both space and time may be zero. Think about that for
      a moment. In what kind of space might the distance between two completely
      different sets of coordinates be zero?</p>
    <p>A spacetime interval of zero or of a small value in no way implies
      proximity from a human perspective. In fact, the only event pairs that may
      have zero interval between them are events that <i>cannot</i> be observed
      as being simultaneous or local. If they are simultaneous but separate,
      they will have an interval corresponding to their separation in space. If
      they are local (in the same place) but separate, they will have an
      interval corresponding to their separation in time. If, however, their
      separation is such that a beam of light from one event can reach the place
      and time of the other, then these two events have an interval of zero
      between them; and as with all these intervals, its value will be measured
      the same for all observers.</p>
    <p>Though Einstein writes of "neighboring events" and "adjacent points of
      the four-dimensional spacetime continuum,"
      <!--(Hawking 2007, pp.
      171,198-99)-->it is difficult to say what meaning this neighboring or
      adjacency could have. At first glance, these events seem to neighbor one
      another no more than two people neighbor one another whose birthdates,
      number of children, and shoe sizes happen to (closely) coincide. Rather
      than being an expression of physical proximity, Minkowski space must be
      considered a four-dimensional "causality structure," with a zero interval
      between two events meaning that the two events can be causally connected
      only at the speed of light. Non-zero interval values pertain to causal
      relationships as well. Using the convention shown in Equations 31-1 and
      31-2 above to calculate the spacetime interval, values of <i>s<sup>2</sup></i>
      greater than zero indicate that the events can have no causal
      relationship; a value less than zero indicates that the events may be
      causally connected at speeds slower than the speed of light.</p>
    <p>I believe that it is a risky practice to compare the spacetime interval
      to the Pythagorean theorem, even if care is taken to point out that it is
      in some way "modified."
      <!--(<i>e.g. </i>Wolfson and Pasachoff,
      p.1035)--> Any similarity between the two unravels once the zero interval
      is considered; if you, the reader, are not yet convinced, I hope the
      following comparison between the circular geometry of familiar space and
      the hyperbolic geometry of Minkowski space will suffice.</p>
    <p>If we return to Equation 31-1, not introducing any imaginary numbers or
      breaking the distance down into three-dimensional components, the
      difference between the Pythagorean theorem and the spacetime interval is
      more stark. In both cases, we have a left-hand term that represents an
      invariant quantity of some sort. To compare the two metrics correctly, it
      is important that we keep the invariant quantity on the left-hand side of
      each; it would not do, for instance, to make the terms of the spacetime
      equation change sides algebraically until we end up with the same number
      of terms on each side and all terms being added so:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>d<sup>2</sup> = s<sup>2</sup> + t<sup>2</sup></i></p>
      <p> <strong>Equation 31-3</strong>. Don't do this.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This is mathematically correct, but it is not useful for our current
      purpose of comparing the invariant metrics for these two different spaces,
      familiar space and Minkowski spacetime. The spacetime interval <i>s</i>,
      not the distance <i>d</i>, remains invariant between observers in
      different inertial reference frames that measure various values for time
      and distance. The length of a line segment remains invariant, though
      different right triangles may be constructed using this line segment as
      the diagonal (or "hypotenuse"), and though those triangles may have
      various measurements of lengths <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, the other two
      sides of the triangle. The difference between these two invariant metrics
      is that in the Pythagorean relationships of familiar space, the two
      components on the right-hand side are <i>added</i>; in Minkowski
      spacetime, the two are <i>subtracted</i>. In Figure i-7, we saw that
      the&nbsp; Pythagorean relationship describes a <i>circle</i>. It must be
      noted that the spacetime relationship of Equation 31-1 describes a <i>hyperbola</i>,
      quite a different thing altogether. A hyperbola (Figure 31-2, below) looks
      how we might imagine a circle turned inside out.</p>
    <p>Of the spacetime interval, Chad Orzel writes, "[space and time] distances
      add in a hyperbolic manner ... The different rules for adding distances
      seem kind of strange compared to the ordinary Pythagorean theorem, but the
      end result has a certain mathematical elegance that is very pleasing."

    <p>The above plot (in blue lines) of the equation <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> ‐
      <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = 1 can represent a set of measurements between two
      events having a spacetime interval of 1, with distance on the <i>x</i>
      axis and time on the <i>y</i> axis (1<sup>2 </sup>= <em>d</em><sup>2</sup>
      ‐ <em>t</em><sup>2</sup>). The (<i>x,y</i>) coordinates (1,0) satisfy
      this equation and represent this pair of events being measured as having 1
      unit of separation in space and no separation in time; in other words, the
      events are simultaneous in the reference frame in which they are measured
      as being one unit distant. Note that in all other frames of reference
      (represented by all other points on this blue hyperbolic curve) the events
      are measured as being both more distant in space <i>and</i> more
      separated in time. It is not the case that space "rotates into" time as a
      matter of four-dimensional perspective, with space decreasing and time
      increasing in the way that length may rotate into depth in Euclidean
      space; though Kaku seems to be saying otherwise when he writes, "By a
      simple rotation, we can interchange the any of the three spatial
      dimensions. Now if time is the fourth dimension, then it is possible to
      make 'rotations' that convert space into time and vice versa."
      <!--(Kaku, p. 85) -->There is one context in which Kaku’s analogy seems
      less inappropriate and I will discuss it below.</p>
    <p>In <i>Hiding in the Mirror</i>, Lawrence M. Krauss is diligent in
      cautioning the reader not to equate Minkowski spacetime with familiar
      space. Perhaps it is for this reason that I wince all the more at his
      statement that "one man’s space interval can be another man’s time
      interval," as this implies the same sort of rotation that Kaku seems to
      describe above, one in which one aspect of a measurement dwindles while
      another grows. I would rather it be said that "one person’s pure space
      measurement between two events is another’s measurement of <em>greater </em>space
      <em> and </em>additional time." Even if it is true in some technical
      sense, why would anyone consider it instructive to call this a rotation
      without extensively qualifying that statement?</p>
    <p>Also, in what might be mistaken for a contradiction of the main
      presentation he gives regarding Minkowski spacetime, Krauss states much
      later in his book that "there is nothing about the four-dimensional
      spacetime of Minkowski … that is remotely non-Euclidean." In this context
      he argues that such a space is flat, and in this he is correct; but this
      may tend to undermine his earlier clarification that "space and time are
      tied together in a way quite unlike the way <i>up</i> and <i>sideways</i>
      are tied together." As he points out, "people most often hear what they
      want to hear, and consequently they often tend to interpret the new
      results of science in terms that justify their previous expectations."
      <!--(Krauss, pp. 46-47,88-89)--> Effective teaching will keep these
      expectations in mind and be careful to make the necessary distinctions.</p>
    <p>In the spacetime interval, the reason that time measurements must be
      subtracted from space measurements is to prevent counting the same aspect
      of separation twice. This is because what I call imaginary time <i>is</i>
      space, but in disguise; if more of one is measured between two events,
      then more of the other is measured as well. Imaginary time, or proper
      time, is the space between the two mirrors of the light clock, the
      distance that the imaginary light pulse must keep re-crossing when it is
      not too hard-pressed to keep up with the movement of the mirrors
      themselves. And the empirical evidence suggests that everything and every
      physical process in the universe experiences proper time in the same way
      the light clock does. We <em>imagine </em>that our proper time involves
      no spatial motion. Proper time seems to be the distance all the smallest
      parts of us travel —&nbsp; whether back and forth across a tiny distance,
      or circling something the size of the nucleus of an atom — while on the
      macroscopic level we remain in place.</p>
    In fairness to Professors Krauss and Kaku, I must now admit that there is
    one sense in which length and time measurements change in opposite ways,
    giving one the impression of rotation in a four-dimensional context in which
    space is at right angles to time. We may picture for ourselves a train car
    at rest, having a length that we measure and containing a number of clocks
    along that length which we may see are all synchronized. Once we set that
    train car in motion, we (at rest) will measure the car’s length to have
    diminished in its direction of motion in the same manner as we would see a
    light clock do so. We would also find that the clocks in the car are out of
    sync from back to front. While the car’s <i>length</i> has diminished, the
    time difference <i>between its clocks</i> has grown. In this way, we might
    suppose there is an analogy to rotation. But Minkowski space is a domain of
    <i>events</i>, namely their locations and times according to the observer;
    the spacetime interval which defines its metric is not a relation between
    observed object length and clock rates. My failure to see this distinction
    is what hindered my understanding of relativity more than anything else.
    While we and the train measure one another to be <i>contracted</i> in one
    direction, the events we each measure to be simultaneous and of a certain
    spatial separation are measured by the other to have <i>greater</i>
    separation in both space and time. Likewise, the events which each of us
    measure to happen in the same place at different times are measured by the
    other to be at different relative distances and even more separated in time.
    <p>My final argument for the three dimensions of space encompassing the
      so-called "dimension" of time as well —&nbsp; final as far as our
      discussion of special relativity is concerned, that is —&nbsp; is that our
      "speed through time" increases with our acceleration through space. The
      so-called "twin paradox" of relativity concerns the astronaut who travels
      at high speed to a destination in far-away space and returns to find his
      twin brother to have aged much more than he. Relativity predicts it, and
      experiment has confirmed it on a much smaller scale. The astronaut
      accelerates into space and back, his clock slows, and thus it may be said
      that he travels "into the future" without aging proportionately. His
      acceleration through space has accelerated his speed "through time."
      <!--"When your speed through space increases, your speed through
      time also increases." (Orzel, p. 161).--> There may be some who mistakenly
      understand as I once did that speed through time is <i>diminished</i> by
      acceleration through space and that our speed through "spacetime" thus
      remains constant, but we should instead understand that there is a
      Pythagorean relationship only between an object’s relative speed through
      space and the relative speed <i>of its clock</i>.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The greatest advantage of the three-dimensional approach is in how it
      places general relativity more fully within the grasp of the lay person
      and of students of a younger age or less extensive mathematical
      background. In Chapter Twenty-Five we saw that changes in the metric of
      three-dimensional space were sufficient to produce relativity's effects on
      what we call "time," and that the rubber-sheet model of spacetime is
      deficient in several ways. The current paradigm seems to reserve some of
      the beauty of relativity only for those having the considerable will and
      aptitude necessary to surmount its formidable mathematical barriers. This
      would seem displeasing to Einstein, who wrote:<!-- (Brockman, p. 163)-->
      "Restricting the body of knowledge to a small group deadens the
      philosophical spirit of a people and leads to spiritual poverty." This
      sense of exclusivity reminds me of what the journalist George Johnson
      wrote regarding his discouragement as he considered his college major: </p>
    <blockquote>Going through the physics course descriptions in the university
      catalog, I realized that by my senior year I would be all the way up to
      the nineteenth century. . . . Only many years later, when I’d earned a
      Ph.D., would I be taken into a chamber where, like a thirty-third degree
      Freemason, I’d see the true mysteries revealed ‐the shrinking rulers and
      slowing clocks . . . and why all this made <em>E</em> equal <em>mc</em><sup>2</sup>.</blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    <h4>Real time<br>
    </h4>
    <p>The final thought with which I'd like to conclude this chapter and
      Section Three of this book is a concept of "real time" to contrast with
      what I have been calling "imaginary time." I have to admit that the idea
      is still in development, so this may sound a little hand-wavy, vague,
      trite, or tautological. But since "real time" isn't the kind that we do
      math with, I suppose that's all okay. I think of real time as having the
      same three dimensions of space. It flows in all directions, but never in a
      line. Around in circles, perhaps. Maybe inward or outward in all
      directions at once. Maybe both inward <em>and </em>outward, like a pair
      of light cones. The "imaginary" time that we have been studying throughout
      this book we eventually found to have the same curvature as space, because
      imaginary time <em>is</em> space. Real time is what happens in that
      space. Real time is the inward and outward flow of energy, just as motion
      is the linear flow of mass. Energy flows outward with time; light radiates
      and heat dissipates. Mass is energy flowing in reverse, inward on itself
      rather than outward and gathering more mass to add to itself. Gravity
      changes the direction of time toward the greatest concentration of mass.
      Time changes direction at the event horizon, where it stops.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>To realize the impossibility of building a time machine, we needn’t
      discuss the causal paradoxes inherent in time travel, such as the
      possibility of preventing one’s own birth. We need only consider the
      nature of time. The energies and masses of the past radiate outwards at
      speeds up to the speed of light. The past of 30 years ago is not located
      at 30 years’ distance along a single physical time axis; it is scattered
      in all directions up to thirty light years away. Good luck reassembling
      all that using the "flux capacitor" in your Delorean, Doc Brown. I love
      you but you’re out of your mind. </p>
    <p>Real time may also be the long-awaited answer for those who are
      unsatisfied, even horrified, by the idea of a fully determined
      four-dimensional reality
      <!--Smolin, Time Reborn-->that is revealed to us second by second as we
      move forward in time, spectators enjoying an illusory sense of
      participation (see Smolin, <em>Time Reborn</em>). The phrase "in real
      time" means "as it develops, unscripted and unwritten," and the
      unidirectional nature of real time seems to make it more obvious that time
      is nature's own way of working out what happens next.</p>
