    <h4>Preface</h4>
    <p> In the fall of 2022 it was my great pleasure to see and hear the orcas
      of J pod at Lime Kiln State Park with David Neiwert (see bibliography<em></em>)
      and his son Devin.&nbsp; </p>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Einstein's visit with Henry Ford is entirely a product of my imagination.
      Had Ford asked Einstein in 1935 for a simple thought experiment to convey
      the meaning and essence of relativity, Einstein would have been more
      likely to have taken Ford to look down from the top of the university's
      highest building and then to have explained that the happiest thought of
      his career was that a man falling from a rooftop does not feel any of the
      effects of gravity (until he strikes ground, of course). We will analyze
      and criticize Einstein's "happiest thought" in Chapter Twenty-Nine.</p>
    <h4>Fit the First: <em>On Fugues</em></h4>
    <p>It has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and
      you will find much of that here. This vignette is in equal parts a
      shameless imitation of, an adoring homage to, and an unfair satire of,
      Douglas Hofstadter's famous tome <em>G</em><em><em>ö</em>del, Escher,
        Bach</em>. It is therefore equally self-referential, and any facetious
      criticism of his work implicit in what I have written here is at least as
      applicable to my own. Anyone even passingly familiar with Hofstadter's
      book is likely to notice at several points in this one where I have taken
      cues and inspiration from <em>GEB</em>, though I must confess that even
      after decades of admiring it I — like Achilles —&nbsp; have yet to reach
      its finish line. In Hofstadter's honor, I have given the tortoise the
      feminine gender, a decision he wished to have come to earlier than he did.
      Lewis Carroll, from whom Hofstadter took his own inspiration, gave the
      tortoise no gender at all; Hofstadter's tortoise became feminine in some
      of his book's foreign editions.</p>
    <p>The use of the word "fit" to title subdivisions of a longer work
      originates with Lewis Carroll's poem <em>The Hunting of the Snark </em>
      ("An Agony in Eight Fits") This convention was imitated by the radio
      series <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>. Speaking of the <em>Guide</em>,
      the tablet the tortoise reads from is in some respects similar. Douglas
      Adams anticipated Wikipedia in some ways, but allowed the entire
      enterprise to fall under the control of the Vogons ("a horde of
      bureaucrats who'd be perfectly happy to destroy this planet and everyone
      on it"). The tortoise having found the tablet discarded by the roadside
      stems from my memory of Arthur Dent having thrown his copy of the Guide
      into a river on prehistoric Earth. Achilles asking the tortoise what she
      is reading is intended as an imitation to Hamlet's dialogue with Polonius,
      which I re-imagine later in this book.

    <h4> Chapter One: Mapping Space</h4>
    <p><em>Recommended resource</em>s: </p>

        particularly for its discussion of how mankind's understanding of space
        has evolved over time. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Chapter Two: Mapping Time</h4>
    <p> Long before Magellan's time and hundreds of years before the
      implementation of the International Date Line, the Arab geographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abulfeda">Abulfeda
        </a>(1273–1331) made the earliest known prediction that those who
      circumnavigated the globe would accumulate a one-day offset in their
      reckoning of time, depending on which direction they traveled. Alas,
      Magellan and Mr. Fogg were not aware.</p>
    <p>Figure 2-2 is described as showing the earth's rotation "at equinox"
      because it is only during these two times of year that the north and south
      poles would be on the line between day and night, or more precisely,
      between sunlight and shadow. Due to the tilt of the earth relative to its
      orbit around the sun, the poles remain in the earth's shadow for six
      months at a time.</p>
    <h4>Fit the Second: <em>Circus Canon</em></h4>
    <p>In the early 1930s, Einstein did come to Oxford as a guest lecturer and
      stayed in the rooms once occupied by Lewis Carroll, whose other
      professional identity was the mathematician Charles Dodgson (see
      Robinson's <em>Einstein On The Run</em>, p. 173). </p>
    <p>Does anyone here remember usenet? <br>
      <!--(Robinson, p. 173) Einstein stayed in Carroll's room. First in May 1931 to give three lecturers. Came to Oxford again May '32, then again May-Jun 1933--></p>
    <h4>Chapter Eight: Mechanical Perspective (I)</h4>
    <p>"<em>Even now, physicists occasionally stumble when relating projectile
        motion below to planetary orbits above.</em>" See, for instance, Lee
      Smolin's <em>Time Reborn</em> (page 21): "Ellipses trace the planetary
      orbits and parabolas trace the paths of falling bodies on Earth." This
      fallacy is discussed at length in Chapter Sixteen.</p>

    </ul>
    <h4>Chapter Nine: Mapping Forces</h4>
    <p>I wanted to mention Benjamin Franklin in connection with my comments on
      static electricity, but I didn't see a place where it wouldn't have
      interrupted the flow. Franklin is so well-remembered as a statesman, even
      I had started to forget his work as a scientist. </p>
    <h4>Chapter Eleven: Math Vocabulary (I)</h4>
    <p>"<em>Calculus is thought to have been an invention of necessity for
        Newton, though Gottfried Leibniz arrived at many of the same ideas
        independently around the same time.</em>" For further information on the
      history of the development of calculus, see <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-calculus-was-invented-before-Leibniz-and-Newton-in-India">https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-calculus-was-invented-before-Leibniz-and-Newton-in-India</a><br>
    </p>
    <p>"<em>the answer involves calculus (which really isn't that difficult once
        you throw away the tedious first third of your textbook dealing with
        limits and the fundamental theorem of calculus)</em>" I think it's poor
      practice that a typical calculus course subjects students to this material
      before getting to the practical applications of calculus. Yes, show us <em>why
        </em>calculus works, but only if we care after having been shown <em>how</em><em></em>.</p>
    <h4>Chapter Twelve: Electromagnetism (I)</h4>
    <p>One of the many ideas that caught my eye but didn't make it into the main
      text was something in Wolfon and Pasachoff's Physics for Scientists and
      Engineers (their Figure 18-32b). A ball with angular speed <strong>ω</strong>
      and velocity <strong>v</strong> through a mass of air experiences a force
      <strong>ω</strong>x<strong>v</strong> which is analogous to q<strong>v</strong>x<strong>B</strong>.
      I wouldn't have expected aerodynamics and electromagnetism to have that
      math in common, but there we are.</p>
    <h4>Chapter Fourteen: Clockwork in Reverse</h4>
    <p>Here is the relevant excerpt from Carroll's <em>Sylvie and Bruno
        Concluded </em>(1893):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"They run their railway-trains without any engines nothing is needed
        but machinery to stop them with. Is that wonderful enough,Miladi?" </p>
      <p>"But where does the force come from ? " I ventured to ask. </p>
      <p>Mein Herr turned quickly round, to look at the new speaker. Then he
        took off his spectacles, and polished them, and looked at me again, in
        evident bewilderment. I could see he was thinking - as indeed I was also
        - that we must have met before. </p>
      <p>"They use the force of <em>gravity</em>" he said. "It is a force known
        also in <em>your </em>country, I believe?" </p>
      <p>"But that would need a railway going <em>down-hill,</em>" the Earl
        remarked. " You ca'n't have <em>all </em>your railways going
        down-hill?"</p>
      <p> "They <em>all </em>do," said Mein Herr. </p>
      <p>"Not from <em>both </em>ends?" </p>
      <p>"From <em>both </em>ends." </p>
      <p>"Then I give it up!" said the Earl. </p>
      <p>"Can you explain the process?" said Lady Muriel. "Without using that
        language, that I ca'n't speak fluently?"</p>
      <p> "Easily," said Mein Herr. "Each railway is in a long tunnel, perfectly
        straight: so of course the <em>middle </em>of it is nearer the centre
        of the globe than the two ends: so every train runs half-way <em>down</em>-hill,
        and that gives it force enough to run the <em>other </em>half <em>up</em>-hill."
        </p>
      <p>"Thank you. I understand that perfectly," said Lady Muriel." But the
        velocity, in the <em>middle </em>of the tunnel, must be something <em>fearful</em>!"
        </p> </blockquote>

    <p>As an amusing aside, the opposite points of the earth which such a train
      might connect are called <em>antipodes</em>. In a much earlier novel,
      Carroll's Alice mispronounces the word as "antipathies."&nbsp; </p>

    <h4>Chapter Seventeen: Mapping the Earth (II)</h4>
    <p>Poincaré's description of a world where changes in size are driven by
      temperature calls to mind Alice's ability in Wonderland to shrink by
      fanning herself. When Alice is told to "keep her temper," the more archaic
      second meaning is that she must take care that her changes in size all
      happen in proportion rather than, for instance, growing a serpent-like
      neck. </p>
    <p>I had originally intended to show the metric tensor and the calculation
      of distance with covariant vector components, but after realizing I had
      gotten it wrong on my first attempt I decided that the whole affair was
      better suited for the end notes. What I had forgotten to do was to include
      the dot products of the dual bases with themselves.</p>
    <p>Since the angle θ between the <em>covariant </em>components&nbsp; <strong>v</strong><sub>1</sub>
      and <strong>v</strong><sub>2</sub> (and between the dual basis vectors <em>
      </em> <strong>e</strong><sup>1</sup> and <strong>e</strong><sup>2</sup>)
      is π (180 degrees) minus the angle φ <strong></strong>(Figure 17-32)
      between the two basis vectors <em></em> <strong>e</strong><sub>1</sub>
      and <em></em> <strong>e</strong><sub>2</sub>, we could rewrite this as :
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <em>v</em><sup>2</sup> = <strong>(v</strong><sub>1</sub>)<strong></strong><sup>2</sup>
        + &nbsp; (<strong>v</strong><sub>2</sub>)<strong></strong><sup>2</sup> -
        2( <strong>v</strong><sub>1</sub> <strong>v</strong><sub>2</sub>cos(π-
        φ )) = = 1<strong>v</strong><sub>1</sub><strong>v</strong><sub>1</sub> -
        1<strong>v</strong><sub>1</sub><strong>v</strong><sub>2</sub>cos(π- φ
        )&nbsp; - 1<strong>v</strong><sub>2</sub><strong>v</strong><sub>1</sub>cos(π-
        φ )&nbsp; + 1<strong>v</strong><sub>2</sub><strong>v</strong><sub>2</sub></p>
      <p><strong>Equation 17-3.</strong> The length of a vector in terms of its
        covariant components and the angle between them and between the dual
        basis vectors.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>where π- φ is the angle between the two covariant components of <strong>v</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>In terms of a metric tensor, this would be as follows in Figure 17-35,
      remembering that the elements of this tensor are indexed as shown in
      Figure 17-36:</p>

    <h4>Fit the Fifth: <em>At the Non Sequitur</em></h4>
    <p>To those readers wondering what on earth this chapter was all about, I
      thank you for indulging me in a bit of fun. This<strong> </strong>was the
      first chapter of the book written largely — if not solely — for the
      purpose of entertainment (preferably, yours as well as mine); others
      followed, eventually to become this book's "fits." It all began with the
      idea of Hamlet's tribute to Einstein. Several other aspects of this scene
      seemed to develop together, and I decided to lean into the obvious
      anachronism of its premise; it presented itself as a humorous way to
      precede a more serious discussion of time (and a certain loss of
      sequentiality) in the next chapter. I decided to name the inn the Non
      Sequitur (Latin for "it does not follow"), and to play with the comedic <em>non
        sequitur </em>in the tradition of two of the great plays whose
      characters I have borrowed and placed in this setting. </p>
    <p>Alice's tutor would presumably have been Lewis Carroll himself, who
      taught mathematics at Oxford under his real name, Charles Dodgson. I have
      cast the former Oxford-area furniture dealer Theophilus Carter (a.k.a. the
      Mad Hatter) as the owner of this restaurant. See page 69 of <em>The
        Annotated Alice</em> for more amusing background on the historical and
      fictional Mad Hatters. </p>
    <p>The inn's relationship with time is not unlike that of the Hatter's Mad
      Tea-Party, but perhaps more like the concept of Douglas Adams' Milliways,
      <em>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</em> where people "of all
      ages" might mingle, and where it is always the same time. Adams borrowed
      from Carroll many times; compare his "If you've done 6 impossible things
      this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways" with this
      snippet of dialogue from <em>Through the Looking-Glass</em>: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Alice laughed. “There’s no use trying,” she said: “one can’t believe
        impossible things.” </p>
      <p>“I daresay you haven’t had much practice,” said the Queen. “When I was
        your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve
        believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I only wrote the dialogue around the reception desk in order to smooth
      the way for my Edgar Allan Poe reference (which also pointed to the
      strange cyclical time of Milliways and the Tea Party); but having done
      that, I decided that the hostess ought to give her responses subtly out of
      sequence in her dialogue with Alice. Perhaps she is related to the White
      Queen?</p>
    <p>The philosophers song was written by Eric Idle of Monty Python (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9SqQNgDrgg"

        target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9SqQNgDrgg</a>). In
      regards to the posters on the wall, my non-exhaustive survey of time
      travel in cinema finds that the stand-alone movies (those not having
      sequels or prequels to speak of) often feature strange loops (which I note
      with a nod in the direction of Douglas Hofstadter).</p>
    <p>Some of the humor just wrote itself. I didn't have his paradoxes in mind
      when I wrote Zeno's comment about not yet having managed to get to the
      Restaurant at the End of the Universe; I hope that line strikes others as
      funny as it did me.</p>
    <p>Alas, something instructive did find its way into this chapter, but I
      only allowed it because I found it too amusing. Rosencrantz's retort to
      Guildenstern reflects a key concept in this book, indeed one that relates
      to its title: that we are not always justified in asserting that something
      has or has not yet taken place somewhere else. This idea is developed
      further in the following chapter, in a subsequent chapter again featuring
      these characters, and finally in the concluding chapter, "Einstein's Cat."</p>
    <p>The quotation that ends this chapter is an "aside" from Polonius in the
      play <em>Hamlet</em>, taken from a scene that I have parodied in a
      subsequent "fit." It seems fitting both for that reason and as my excuse
      for what I have written as this "fit."</p>

    <h4>Chapter Twenty: Special Relativity</h4>
    <p>See Robinson's <em>Einstein on the Run</em> regarding Einstein
      discussing Poincaré with his mates Habicht and Solovine. The trio
      "...argued in detail about a recently published book, <em>Science and
        Hypothesis</em> . . ." </p>
    <p>"As early as 1898, Poincaré questioned the meaning of simultaneity over
      large distances and wrote that there may not be a meaningful, universally
      applicable time." See Orzel, <em>Timekeeping, </em>pp. 199-202 regarding
      Poincaré's 1898 "The Measure of Time."
      <!--Minkowski  1908: see Orzel, Timekeeping, p. 226.--></p>
    <p>This bonus figure shows how various proper distances (on the <em>y</em>
      axis) become infinite at various speeds (as a percentage of the speed of
      light): </p>

    <h4>Chapter <em>i</em><sup>2</sup>: Imaginary Geometry</h4>
    See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space#Complex_Minkowski_spacetime"

      target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space#Complex_Minkowski_spacetime</a>
    for the quotation below:
    <p></p>
    <blockquote>In his second relativity paper in 1905–06 Henri Poincaré showed
      how, by taking time to be an imaginary fourth spacetime coordinate<em> ict</em>,
      where <em>c</em> is the speed of light and <em>i</em> is the imaginary
      unit, Lorentz transformations can be visualized as ordinary rotations of
      the four dimensional Euclidean sphere <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>
      + <em>z</em><sup>2</sup> + (<em>ict</em>)<sup>2</sup> = const . Poincaré
      set<em> c</em> = 1 for convenience. . ...<br>
      The analogy with Euclidean rotations is only partial since the radius of
      the sphere is actually imaginary which turns rotations into rotations in
      hyperbolic space (see hyperbolic rotation). This idea, which was mentioned
      only briefly by Poincaré, was elaborated by Minkowski in a paper in German
      published in 1908 called "The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic
      Processes in Moving Bodies". Minkowski, using this formulation, restated
      the then-recent theory of relativity of Einstein. In particular, by
      restating the Maxwell equations as a symmetrical set of equations in the
      four variables<em> (x, y, z, ict</em>) combined with redefined vector
      variables for electromagnetic quantities, he was able to show directly and
      very simply their invariance under Lorentz transformation. He also made
      other important contributions and used matrix notation for the first time
      in this context. From his reformulation he concluded that time and space
      should be treated equally, and so arose his concept of events taking place
      in a unified four-dimensional spacetime continuum. </blockquote>
    <p>Einstein used both systems of notation in his 1916 general-audience book
      <em>Relativity</em>.</p>

    <h4>Chapter Twenty-Five: General Relativity</h4>
    <p>I found <a href="https://www.geometrygames.org/CurvedSpaces/" target="_blank">https://www.geometrygames.org/CurvedSpaces/</a>
      very amusing. This is NOT the idea of curved spaces that I will be
      presenting here, but an idea of this type was entertained by Einstein:
      that the universe might be unbounded yet finite. That the
      three-dimensional universe could loop back on itself in all directions is
      an idea that seems too slippery for my mind to grasp very tightly.</p>
    <p>The rows and columns of books of maps is a metaphor for the phase space
      explained by Grant Sanderson (<a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/differential-equations"

        target="_blank">https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/differential-equations</a>,
      cited above) and Sean Carroll (<em>Biggest Ideas</em>, p. 76-80) On
      Carroll's page 80: "The entire trajectory is fixed by knowing what point
      to start at;" page 99: "According to the Laplacian paradigm, specifying
      one point in phase space at one moment in time is enough to determine the
      entire trajectory of a system."</p>

    <h4>Fit the Sixth: <em>The Walrus and the Carpenter</em></h4>
    <p>"I am he as you are he . . ."&nbsp; In<em> Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
        Are Dead</em>, the confusion of one character with the other is a
      running joke which apparently extends a long-standing thespian tradition:
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern</a>.
      I'll leave it to you to puzzle out the thematic references I make to
      Carroll's poem here. </p>
    <h4>Fit the Seventh: <em>Return to the Non Sequitur</em></h4>
    <p>Scene one is a satire of the gravediggers scene in <em>Hamlet</em> which
      takes aim at certain celebrity scientists who shall remain unnamed in this
      context. "Eric Geller" is a mashup of names of two sensationalists of a
      bygone generation. </p>
    In this chapter, Hamlet is a quantum system that Rosencrantz intends to
    interrogate. In scene two, he is the particle passing through two slits.
    Which version of scene two is "real" depends on its time order relative to
    scenes one and three, which take place elsewhere. From Gribbin's <em>In
      Search of Schrödinger's Cat</em>, page 175: "Our world is a hybrid
    combination of the two possible worlds corresponding to the two routes for
    the particle, and each world interferes with the other." <strong></strong>
    <p>Scene two is parody of another scene in <em>Hamlet </em>(Act II, Scene
      2). The comedic non sequitur was integral to the original. Some of the
      dialogue still fits my story but with a new meaning that touches directly
      on the "Einstein's Cat" question (Introduction and Conclusion). </p>
    <p>The limerick Rosencrantz has written on the wall is my adaptation of an
      original by A.&nbsp;H. Reginald Buller, published in a 1923 issue of <em>Punch
        </em>(see<a href="%20https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/a-young-lady-named-bright-etc/"

        target="_blank">
        https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/a-young-lady-named-bright-etc/</a>).
      This is also a bawdy allusion to Hamlet's mother, who in her "haste"
      "wandered" in a "relative way" in allowing herself to be wooed by her
      deceased husband's brother "the previous knight", setting the "time" "out
      of joint" in a different sense than how the reverse time travel of the
      limerick would cause a paradox. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h4></h4>
    <h4>Chapter Thirty-One: In Defense of a Three-Dimensional Spacetime</h4>
    In the ten years since the publication of <em>Time Reborn</em>, Lee Smolin
    seems to have found a more satisfying concept of the meaning of the
    present:&nbsp; "In the Copenhagen version of quantum mechanics, there is a
    quantum world and there is a classical world, and a boundary between them:
    when things become definite. When things that are indefinite in the quantum
    world become definite. And what they’re trying to say is that is the
    fundamental thing that happens in nature, when things that are indefinite
    become definite. And that’s what “now” is. The moment now, the present
    moment, that all these people say is missing from science and missing from
    physics, that is the transition from indefinite to definite." <a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/are-we-approaching-quantum-gravity-all-wrong/"

    <br>
    <h4>Fit The Eighth:<em> The Hall of Mirrors</em><br>
    </h4>
    <p>In this chapter, the "Alice" we have come to know from the previous
      "fits" turns out to be a story-within-a-story; she is the creation of an
      early-mid-90s cyberpunk by the name of Alice who shares an affection for
      Lewis Carroll with one of her favorite authors, Douglas Adams. Unlike
      Carroll's Alice, this one writes her own story. Inspired in part by the <em>Hitchhiker's
        Guide to the Galaxy</em>, she has envisioned a future in which
      information is more free, not tethered to university enrollment or to a
      9600-baud telephone connection. In the words of the Sex Pistols song she
      parodied, she is a "dog's body" with a "council tenancy." In that she has
      anticipated such things ahead of her time, she is like Thomasina in
      Stoppard's <em>Arcadia</em>.</p>
    <p>How can you write Alice without parody verse? You have to include it, and
      it's best to aim it at something that is taken too seriously. Lewis
      Carroll was a brilliant satirist, subverting overly-sober popular poems
      and replacing their moral lessons with absurdities ("<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_Old,_Father_William"

        target="_blank">You Are Old, Father William</a>"). This was in the same
      grand tradition as Warner Brothers studios' take on "Ride of the
      Valkyries" starring Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd ("<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Opera,_Doc%3F"

        target="_blank">What's Opera, Doc?</a>"), and "Weird Al" Yankovic's
      "Theme From Rocky XIII."</p>
    <p>Chapter one of <em>Through the Looking Glass</em> has one of Alice's two
      kittens playing with a ball of yarn and making a mess "all knots and
      tangles." Later Tweedledee and Tweedledum spar over a "spoiled" rattle.</p>
